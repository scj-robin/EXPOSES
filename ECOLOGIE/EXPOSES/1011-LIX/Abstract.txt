Bayesian Model Averaging for Estimating Species Abundance.
Application to Metagenomics

The species abundance distribution (SAD) and the total number of
species are fundamental descriptors of the biodiversity of an
ecological community. The present contribution focuses on situations
where large numbers of rare species are not observed in the dataset
due to insufficient sampling of the community, as is the case in
metagenomics for the study of microbial diversity. 

We propose a truncated mixture model for the observations, which
explicitely accounts for the missing data, and describe methods to
estimate its parameters in a Bayesian approach with variational
methods. Instead of choosing the number of components of the mixture,
we use Bayesian Model Averaging to aggregate the estimates provided by
each model.
