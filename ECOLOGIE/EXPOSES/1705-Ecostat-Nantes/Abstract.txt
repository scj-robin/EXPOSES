Probabilistic multivariate analysis of count data: Application to community ecology

S. Robin, joint work with J. Chiquet & M. Mariadassou

Many application domains such as ecology or genomics have to deal with multivariate non Gaussian observations. A typical example is the joint observation of the respective abundances of a set of species in a series of sites, aiming to understand the co-variations between these species. The Gaussian setting provides a canonical way to model such dependencies, but does not apply in general. We consider here the multivariate exponential family framework for which we consider here a generic model with multivariate Gaussian latent variables. We show that approximate maximum likelihood inference can be achieved via a variational EM algorithm, for which gradient descent easily applies. We show that this setting enables us to account for covariates and offsets. Then we focus on the case of the Poisson-lognormal model in the context of community ecology. Eventually, we show that the detour through the Gaussian framework enables us to tackle more complex tasks such as network inference.
