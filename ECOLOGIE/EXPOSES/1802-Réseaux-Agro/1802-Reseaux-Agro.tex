\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Motivation:} Interaction process, e.g.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Interactions between individuals along time
 \item Mails exchanges
 \item Bikes moves from one station to another
\end{itemize}
\ra Directed formulation (can be adapted to undirected contacts).

\paragraph{Questions.}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Is it possible to clusters the nodes into groups with different roles?
 \item Do the node change role along time?
\end{itemize}

\nocite{MaM16}

\paragraph{Notations.}
\begin{itemize}
 \item $n$ nodes $1 \leq i ,j \leq n$
 \item Observation time: $0 < t < T$
 \item Data: $\{(t_m, i_m, j_m)\}_{1 \leq m \leq M}$:
  $$
  (t_m, i_m, j_m) = \{\text{node $i_m$ sends an interaction to node $j_m$ at time $t_m$}\}
  $$
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Group membership.} $\{Z_i(t)\}_t =$ hidden group membership of node $i$ at time $t$:
$$
\{Z_i\}_i \text{ iid}, 
\qquad 
Z_i \sim \text{homogeneous Markov jump process with generator } Q
$$

\paragraph{Interaction process.} $\{Y_{ij}(t)\}_t$ observed interaction process from node $i$ to node $j$.
\begin{align*}
  \{Y_{ij}\}_{ij} & \text{ independent conditional on the } \{Z_i\}_i, \\
  Y_{ij} | Z_i ,Z_j & \sim \text{heterogeneous Poisson process rate } \gamma_{Z_i(t), Z_j(t)}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Parameters.}
\begin{itemize}
 \item $q_\kl =$ rate for jumps from group $k$ to group $\ell$.
 \item $\gamma_\kl =$ intensity of of the interaction from group $k$ to group $\ell$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Simplifying assumptions}

\paragraph{Group membership.} 
$$
\pi_\kl(\delta) := P(Z_i(t+\delta) = \ell | Z_i(t) = k) = \left[ \exp(\delta Q) \right]_\kl
: \text{ hard to evaluate / optimize}
$$
Take 
$$
q_\kl = \lambda \nu_\ell
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
\pi_\kl(\delta) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
   \nu_\ell (1 - e^{-\lambda \delta}) & \text{if } k \neq \ell \\
   e^{-\lambda \delta} + \nu_k (1 - e^{-\lambda \delta}) & \text{if } k = \ell \\
  \end{array}
\right.
$$ 
where
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\nu = [\nu_k]_k:$ distribution of the next state, when changing
 \item $\lambda:$ jump rate
 \item Actual change rate $= \lambda (1 - \nu' \nu)$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interaction process.} Letting $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{M+1} = T$
\begin{align*}
 \log p_\theta(Y_{ij} | Z_i, Z_j)
 & = \sum_{m: i_m=i, j_m=j} \log \gamma_{Z_i(t_m) Z_j(t_m)} 
 - \int_0^T \gamma_{Z_i(t) Z_j(t)} \dd t \\
 & = \sum_{m: i_m=i, j_m=j} \log \gamma_{Z_i(t_m) Z_j(t_m)} 
 - \sum_{m=1}^{M+1} \int_{t_{m-1}}^{t_m} \gamma_{Z_i(t) Z_j(t)} \dd t
 : \text{ hard to evaluate / optimize}
\end{align*}
Assuming that all $\delta_m = t_m - t_{m-1}$ are small, denoting $Z_i^m = Z_i(t_m)$,
$$
\int_{t_{m-1}}^{t_m} \gamma_{Z_i(t) Z_j(t)} \dd t
\simeq \delta_m (Z_i^{m-1} Z_j^{m-1} + Z_i^m Z_j^m) / 2.
$$

\paragraph{Aim.}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Estimate $\theta = (\lambda, \nu, \gamma)$
 \item Retrieve the hidden paths $Z_i(t)$ or, at least, the $Z_i^m$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Maximum likelihood}

\paragraph{EM principle.} Let $Y = \{Y_{ij}(t)\}_{i, j ,t}$ and $\Zf = \{Z_i(t)\}_{i, t}$,
$$
\log p_\theta(Y) = \Esp[\log p_\theta(Y, \Zf) | Y] - \Esp[\log p_\theta(\Zf|Y) | Y]
$$
Denoting $Z = \{Z^m_i\}_{i, m}$, the approximation of the integral leads to
$$
p_\theta(Y|\Zf) \simeq p_\theta(Y|Z)
$$
so we use
$$
\log p_\theta(Y) = \Esp[\log p_\theta(Y, Z) | Y] - \Esp[\log p_\theta(Z|Y) | Y].
$$
Furthermore, denoting $Z^m = \{Z_i^m\}_i$
$$
Y^m = \{Y_{ij}(t)\}_{i, j, (t_{m-1}+t_m)/2 < t < (t_m+t_{m+1})/2}
$$
we get
$$
p_\theta(Y, Z) 
= p_\theta(Z) \times p_\theta(Y|Z)
= p_\theta(Z^0) \prod_{m=1}^{M+1} p_\theta(Z^m|Z^{m-1}) \times \prod_{m=0}^{M+1} p_\theta(Y^m | Z^m)
$$
\ra Regular (multivariate) hidden Markov model (HMM)

\paragraph{Conditional distribution.} Still, letting $Z_{ik}^m = \Ibb\{Z_i^m = k\}$, EM requires to evaluate 
$$
\Esp(Z_{ik}^m | Y), \qquad
\Esp(Z_{ik}^{m-1} Z_{i\ell}^m | Y), \qquad
\Esp(Z_{ik}^m Z_{j\ell}^m | Y),
$$
where $Z^m$ has $K^n$ states.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Variational approximation}

\paragraph{General principle.} Replace $p_\theta(Z|Y)$ with some distribution $\pt(Z)$, $\pt \in \Qcal$  and maximize
$$
J(\theta ,\pt) 
= \log p_\theta(Y) - KL[\pt(Z)|p_\theta(Z|Y)] \\
= \Espt[\log p_\theta(Y, Z)] - \Espt[\log \pt(Z)].
$$
We choose
$$
\pt(Z) = \prod_i \pt_i(Z_i)
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
\Espt(Z_{ik}^m Z_{j\ell}^m) = \Espt(Z_{ik}^m) \Espt(Z_{j\ell}^m)
$$
which leads to a mean field approximation \cite{BKM17}:
$$
\log \pt_i(Z_i) = \Espt_{- i} \log p_\theta(Y, Z) + \text{cst}.
$$

\paragraph{Variational E step.} Letting 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $Y_i^m = \{Y_{ij}(t), Y_{ji}(t)\}_{j, (t_{m-1}+t_m)/2 < t < (t_m+t_{m+1})/2}$,
 \item $\log \phit_k^m(Y_i^m) = \Espt_{Z_{-i}} \log p_\theta(Y_i^m | Z_i^m = k)$
\end{itemize}
we get
$$
\log \pt(Z_i)
= \sum_k Z_{ik}^0 \log \nu_k 
+ \sum_{m=1}^{M+1} Z_{ik}^{m-1} Z_{i\ell}^m \log \pi_\kl(\delta_m)
+ \sum_{m, k} Z_{ik}^m \log \phit_k^m(Y_i^m)
+ c_i
$$
\ra $\Pt(Z_i^m=k)$, $\Pt(Z_i^{m-1}=k, Z_i^m=\ell)$ computable via forward-backward recursion.

\subsection{Parameter estimates}

Maximize $J(\theta, \pt)$ wrt $\theta$: nothing special.

\section{Some issues}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Identifiability}

\paragraph{First idea.} Use \cite{AMR09} like for HMM

\ra Not able to accommodate for continuous time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Initialization}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Split $[0, T]$ into $B$ bins ($1 \leq b \leq B$)containing equal number of events;
 \item Fit a Poisson SBM for each bin and get the $\tau_{ik}^b$;
 \item Initialize $\Pt(Z_i(t) = k)$ with $\tau_{ik}^b$ if $t$ is in bin $b$.
\end{enumerate}
\ra Gives reasonable starting guesses for $\nu$ and $\gamma$.

\paragraph{Problems.}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Choosing $B$: large to have small bins so that few individual move within each bin, small to have enough events with each bins.
 \item $B$ has to be consistent with lambda, typically, for a bin with width $\Delta^b$,
 $$
 N \Delta^b \lambda (1-\nu'\nu) < 1.
 $$
\end{itemize}
\ra Initialize $\lambda$ by hand? E.g. $\lambda^0 = 1/T$ or $B/T$?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Model selection}

\paragraph{Heuristic.} $\{Y^m\}_m \sim HMM$:
$$
\log p_\theta(Y, Z) = \log p_\theta(Z) + \log p_\theta(Y | Z)
$$
where
\begin{align*}
  \log p_\theta(Z)
  & = \sum_i \log \nu_{Z_i^0} + \sum_{m \geq 1, i} \log \pi_{Z_i^{m-1}Z_i^m}(\delta_m) 
  & \text{$NM$ terms, $K$ parameters} \\
  \log p_\theta(Y | Z)
  & = \sum_{m \geq 0, i, j} \log \phi(Y_{ij}^m | Z^m)
  & \text{$N^2M$ terms, $K^2$ parameters} \\
  \log p_\theta(Y | Z)
  & = \sum_{m \geq 0} \log \phi(Y_{i_m j_m}[t_{\text{prec}_{ij}(m)}; t_m] | Z^{\text{prec}_{ij}(m)}, Z^m)
  & \text{$M$ terms, $K^2$ parameters}
\end{align*}
where $t_{\text{prec}_{ij}(m)}$ is the last interaction time between $i$ and $j$ before $t_m$:
$$
\text{prec}_{ij}(m)= \max\{0 \leq u < m: i_u = i, j_u = j\}.
$$

\paragraph{Criteria.} 
\begin{align*}
 vBIC & = {J(\widehat{\theta}, \pt) - \frac{K}2 \log(NM) - \frac{K^2}2 \log(\textcolor{blue}{N^2}M)} \\
 vICL & = vBIC + \Espt\log \pt(Z) = vBIC + \sum_i \Espt_i\log \pt_i(Z_i) 
\end{align*}
