We consider the old ecological problem of estimating the total number of species that are present in a given area, based on the number of individuals $X_1, \dots, X_n$ of $n$ observed species. This problem is equivalent to the estimation of the number of unobserved species. Many estimates of this quantity have been proposed and we will present two new ones. 

The first estimate is based on mixtures of parametric distributions. The number of component of the mixture being unknown, we use a model averaging principle combined with variational Bayes inference to derive a credibility interval on the number of unobserved species.

The second estimate in non-parametric, only assuming that the abundance distribution is convexe. We use a representation of convexe discrete distribution in termes of mixture. This representation allows to circumvent identifiability issues.
