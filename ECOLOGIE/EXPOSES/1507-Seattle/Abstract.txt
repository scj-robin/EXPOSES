Unsupervised classification of species: Looking for adaptation shifts in evolution

We consider the diversity of a phenotypic character (or trait) across a set of species. In many cases the common past of all the species is summarized in an evolutionary tree, typically a phylogenetic tree. The diversity of the trait is then expected to be consistent with the evolutionary tree: the trait is expected to be more similar between species that diverged recently than between species that diverged long ago. A natural way to model the diversity is to describe the evolution of the trait as the branching path of a stochastic, where branchings occur according to the tree.
In this work, we look for adaptive shifts, that is to locations within the evolutionary tree where the distribution of the trait abruptly changed. From an ecological view-point, this correspond to adaptation to a sudden change of the environment. This resumes to either a segmentation problem, or a classification problem since species who faced the sames shifts in their past can be considered as a group. We show that maximum-likelihood inference can be achieved via an E-M algorithm, but that this model faces deep identifiability issues, with consequences on model selection.
