Some latent variable models in ecology

Plant pollinator networks
* Bipartite expected degree distribution model
* Motif distribution
* Explicit integration with respect to the latent (star motifs) -> no need for EM

Animal behaviour
* Markov switching discrete-time Hawkes process
* Actually: regular HMM
* Exact E step via forward-backward recursion

Community ecology
* Multivariate Poisson log-normal model
* Variational EM needed, but no statistical guaranty
* Composite likelihood MC-EM inference
