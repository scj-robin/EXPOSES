Statistical inference of incomplete data models to analyse ecological networks

Ecological networks aim at describing the interactions between a set of species sharing a same ecological niche. The interactions constituting a network can be directly observed (e.g. via plant-pollinator contacts) or may need to be reconstructed based on the fluctuations of the species' abundance across different sites. Statistical models are needed either to describe the organisation (or 'topology') of an observed network, or to infer the set of interactions that underlies the joint distribution of the abundances. Various models have been proposed for both purposes.

These lectures will focus on two emblematic families of models. The stochastic block-models (SBM) are dedicated to the topological analysis of observed networks and assumes that species have different roles in the network and that the interaction between them depend on their respective roles. The Poisson log-normal (PLN) model is a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that relies on a Gaussian latent layer. Interestingly, both models are incomplete data models and their statistical inference raise similar issues.

After a brief reminder about most popular methods for the inference of incomplete data models, we will show that they do not apply to SBMs or PLN models. We will introduce inference methods based on variational algorithms, which rely on an approximation of the conditional distribution of the unobserved variables given the observed data. Such algorithms have been shown to be efficient for the inference of a large class of incomplete data models, but their theoretical understanding remains itself incomplete. Eventually, we will discuss various leads to combine variational approximations with statistically grounded estimation procedures.
