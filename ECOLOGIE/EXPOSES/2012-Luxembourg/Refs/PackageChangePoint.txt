Hi Yannick, 

here is a short list of change-point detection packages in R. Parsing the keywords 'changepoint', 'breakpoint' or 'segmentation' tields in tens of packages. I try to summarize the few ones I understand. Guillem Rigaill <guillem.rigaill@inrae.fr> is much more aware than me.

1 - Dynamic programming (in a general framework, including functional losses)
-----------------------
"fpop" (Segmentation using Optimal Partitioning and Function Pruning)
    + "gfpop" (Graph-Constrained Functional Pruning Optimal Partitioning)

2 - Exact optimal segmentation, including a penalty term, leading to almost linear complexity
------------------------------
"changepoint" (Methods for Changepoint Detection)
    -> Killick, R., Fearnhead, P., & Eckley, I. A. (2012). Optimal detection of changepoints with a linear computational cost. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 107(500), 1590-1598.

3 - Binary segmentation (not necessarily exactly optimal, by computationally efficient)
-----------------------
"wbs" (Wild Binary Segmentation for Multiple Change-Point Detection)
    -> Fryzlewicz, P. (2014). Wild binary segmentation for multiple change-point detection. The Annals of Statistics, 42(6), 2243-2281.
    + extension dans "breakfast" (Methods for Fast Multiple Change-Point Detection and Estimation)

4 - Fused-lasso (segmentation via l1 penalty)
---------------
"flsa" (Path Algorithm for the General Fused Lasso Signal Approximator)
    + "genlasso" (Path Algorithm for Generalized Lasso Problems)

Many extensions exists in various ways, includung
* segmenting several series at a time
* imposing constraints on the approximating function (continuity, monotonicity, ...)
* ...
but I do not which one may interest you.
