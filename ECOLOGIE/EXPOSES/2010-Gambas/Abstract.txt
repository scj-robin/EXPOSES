The Poisson log-normal (PLN) model has been introduced by Aitchinson & Ho in 1989 as a generic distribution for multivariate dependent count data. The model builds upon a regression part describing the effect of covariates on the responses and on a multivariate Gaussian latent part encoding the dependency between the responses. The PLN model applies to a wide range of applications, especially in life sciences, including community ecology, single cell analysis, microbiome analysis, etc.
We will first present some recent development about variational approximations for the inference of the model’s parameters. We will then show how a more specific modelling of the latent covariance matrix enables to tackle a series of classical task in statistical modeling, such as dimension reduction or network inference.
