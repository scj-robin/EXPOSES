As more and more network-structured datasets are available, the
statistical analysis of valued graphs has become a common
place. Looking for a latent structure is one of the many strategies
used to better understand the behavior of a network. Several methods
already exist for the binary case.
We present a model-based strategy to uncover groups of nodes in valued
graphs. This framework can be used for a wide span of parametric
random graphs models. Variational tools allow us to achieve
approximate maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of these
models. We provide a simulation study showing that our estimation
method performs well over a broad range of situations.
