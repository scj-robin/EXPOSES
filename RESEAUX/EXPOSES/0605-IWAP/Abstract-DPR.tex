The Erdos-Rényi (ER) model is probably the oldest and simplest model
for random graphs. It is simple and many explicit expressions for its
average and asymptotic properties are known. However it does not fit
well many real-word networks.

One reason is that the vertices of a network are often structured in a
priori unknown clusters (functionally related proteins, social
communities, etc.) with different connectivity properties. We define a
generalization of ER named the Erdos-Rényi mixture for graphs
(ERMG). We derive some of its theoretical properties and propose a
pseudo-EM algorithm to estimate its parameters. 

We apply this modeling to recover the modular structure of a network
of enzymatic reactions.
