Networks motifs: mean and variance for the count

Network motifs  (patterns of interconnections) are at the core  of modern studies  on biological networks,
  trying  to  encompass global  features  such  as  small-world or  scale-free
  properties.  Detection of over- and under-represented motifs may be
  based  on two  different  approaches: either  a  comparison with  randomized
  networks (requiring  the simulation of  a large number of  networks), or
  the comparison  with expected  quantities in some  well-chosen probabilistic
  model. This second approach has been investigated here. We consider
  the classical Erdös-Rényi model but also a
  random graph model that fits the vertex degrees.
In such models, we provide exact  formulas for  the
  expectation  and   the  variance   of  the  number   of  occurrences   of  a
  motif. Generalizations exist for the ERMG model (see previous talk
  of S. Robin) and for oriented motifs in directed graphs.
