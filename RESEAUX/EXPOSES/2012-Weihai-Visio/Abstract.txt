Graphical models provide a powerful framework to analyze and understand the dependency structure relating a set of random variables. The inference of the structure of a graphical model based on realizations of the corresponding variables has received a lot of attention in the last decade. One of the main issue to achieve this task is the exploration of the space of possible graphs, which can not be carried in a naive manner because of combinatorial complexity.

Spanning trees constitute a subset of graph, which fulfill the popular sparsity assumption. Still, the tree structure is a too restrictive assumption for most applications. However, the Matrix-Tree theorem enables to integrate over the set of all spanning tree at the cost of the calculation of a determinant. This algebraic property allows considering a mixture of tree-shaped graphical models.

We will show how mixtures of tree-shapes graphical models can be used to infer the graphical model of a set of variables. The talk will be illustrated with the inference of species interactions in community ecology and to the recovery of the spread path of an epidemic in epidemiology.
