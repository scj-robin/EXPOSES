Uncovering structure in biological networks

Daudin J.-J., Picard F., Robin S.

The Erdös-Rényi model of a network is simple and possesses many
explicit expressions for average and asymptotic properties, but it
does not fit well to real-word networks, especially biological
ones. The vertices of these networks are often structured in prior
unknown clusters (e.g. functionally related proteins or genes) with
different connectivity properties.

We define a generalisation of the Erdös-Rényi model called ERMG for
Erdös-Rényi Mixtures for Graphs. This new model is based on mixture
distributions. We give some of its properties, an algorithm to
estimate its parameters and apply this method to uncover the modular
structure of a network of enzymatic reactions.
