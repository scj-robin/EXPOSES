Modelling heterogeneity in interaction networks

Network analysis has become a very active field of statistics within the last decade. Several models have been proposed to describe and understand the heterogeneity observed in real networks. We will present here several modeling involving latent variables. We will discuss the issues raised by their inference, focusing on the stochastic block model. The presentation will be illustrated with several biological applications.
