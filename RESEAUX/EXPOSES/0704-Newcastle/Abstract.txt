Assessing the exceptionality of network motifs

S. Robin

Getting and analyzing biological interaction networks is 
at the core of systems biology. To help understanding these complex
networks, many recent works have suggested to focus on motifs which
occur more frequently than expected in random.

To identify such exceptional motifs in a given network, we propose a
statistical and analytical method which does not require any
simulation. For this, we first provide an analytical expression of the
mean and variance of the count under any stationary random graph
model. Then we approximate the motif count distribution by a compound
Poisson distribution whose parameters are derived from the mean and
variance of the count. Thanks to simulations, we show that the quality
of our compound Poisson approximation is very good and highly better
than a Gaussian or a Poisson one. The compound Poisson distribution
can then be used to get an approximate $p$-value and to decide if an
observed count is significantly high or not. 

We compare our method to the Mfinder software on PPI data and discuss
the choice of a relevant random graph model to detect over-represented
motifs.
