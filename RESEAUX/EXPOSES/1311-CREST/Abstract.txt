Deciphiring and modelling heterogeneity in interaction networks

Network analysis has become a very active field of statistics within the last decade. Several models have been proposed to describe and understand the heterogeneity observed in real networks. We will present here several modeling involving latent variable. We will discuss the issues raised by their inference, focusing on the stochastic block model. We will describe a variational approach that allows to deal with the complex dependency structure of this model.
