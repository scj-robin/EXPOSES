*Invited Title:* Uncovering structure in interaction networks

*Invited Abstract:* Networks are a natural way to describe the
interaction between biological entities (genes, species, etc…). Flexible
random graphs models are needed to describe the wide variety to
topologies displayed by such networks. Stochastic block models have
become a popular way to describe such topologies. These models are
mixture models, the inference of which raises several statistical
issues. We will present several advances such as some refinement of
variational approximations, a variational Bayes inference or the
introduction of covariates to explain the network structure. These
results will be illustrated with application to molecular and ecological
networks.
