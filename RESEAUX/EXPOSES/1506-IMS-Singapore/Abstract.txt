Some Statistical Aspects of the W-graph Model

W-graph refers to a general class of random graph models that can be seen as a random graph limit. It is characterized by both its graphon function and its motif frequencies. In the past decades, it has been mostly studied from a probabilistic point-of-view and statistical aspects have been addressed only within the las few years.

The stochastic block model is a special case of the W-graph where the graphon function is block-wise constant. In a first part of the presentation, we will propose a variational Bayes approach to estimate the W-graph as an average of stochastic block models with increasing number of blocks. We will derive a variational Bayes algorithm and the corresponding variational weights for model averaging. In the same framework, we will derive the variational posterior frequency of any motif. This approach will be illustrated on both synthetic and real networks analysis.

If time permitted, we will also address the problem of goodness-of-fit (GOF) of a given network model to an observed network, using a specific graphon function as a 'residual' null model. To this aim we will consider the degree distribution of the nodes, and more specifically its variance. Indeed, the degree variance has been considered for a long time as a relevant characteristic to depict the structure of a network. Our aim will be to derive a formal GOF test based on this statistic.
