Title:
Deciphering network structure via stochastic blockmodel

Abstract:
State space models constitute a natural way to describe a latent,
unobserved structure that causes heterogeneity in the observed
data. The stochastic block model is a mixture model for graphs where
the nodes are supposed to belong to unobserved classes, that are to be
recovered. 
 
As for most incomplete data model, the statistical inference is not
straightforward. Variational inference provides a general framework to
achieve approximate maximum likelihood inference in such a
situation. We will show that, the variational approximation is
efficient in this case of network.  

As the stochastic blockmodel performs model-based clustering for
network, it also allows to account for covariates. We will illustrate
these works with applications in molecular biology and ecology.
