\begin{abstract}
  Variational and variational Bayes techniques are popular approaches
  for statistical inference of complex models but their theoretical
  properties are still not well known. Because of both unobserved
  variables and intricate dependency structures, mixture models for
  random graphs constitute a good case study. We first present four
  different variational estimates for the parameters of these models.
  We then compare their accuracy through simulation studies and show
  that the variational Bayes estimates seem the most accurate for
  moderate graph size. We finally re-analyze the regulatory network of
  {\it E. coli} with this approach.
