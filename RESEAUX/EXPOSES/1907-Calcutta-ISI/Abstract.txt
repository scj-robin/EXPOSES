Tree-based mixtures with applications in ecology and epidemiology

St√©phane Robin (AgroParisTech / INRA / univ. Paris-Saclay)

In many applications, we are interested in modeling the joint distribution of set of variables, such as the abundances of a set species in a series of sites, or the disease status of a set of individuals along time. In many cases,  most variables are expected to be marginally dependent, but few are expected to conditionally dependent, meaning that the corresponding graphical model is expected to be connected but sparse.

We will present a class of mixture models, each component of which corresponds to a tree-structured graphical model. More specifically, this mixture model has as many components as there are spanning trees. We will show that fitting such a mixture model is possible via an EM algorithm, using to the so-called matrix-tree theorem, which enables us to sum over all the components in an efficient manner. We will show that this model provides us with the probability for two variables to be conditionally dependent.
 
We will illustrate this work with two applications. The first one aims at reconstructing the interaction network between a set of fish species. The second one aims at reconstructing the social network, along the which an epidemic spreads.
