Using 'null’ models to study biological networks

Network analysis is now one of the most active parts of computational
biology. Most methods refer to some modelling of the network(s) under
study, although the meaning of 'modelling’ varies quite a lot. In
this talk, we will present some methods where the model is neither a
mechanistic description of how the network behaves, nor a realistic
description of the way it has been build. 'Null’ models can be seen
as naive and yet reasonably faithful descriptions of what is
observed. Such a model must account for some information, and enable
us to discover some other information. 

We will consider the problem of motif detection in interaction or
metabolic network. We will present several random graph models that
can be used as null models. We will then show how they can be used to
detect exceptional patterns in a network, or to compare networks based
on patterns frequencies.
