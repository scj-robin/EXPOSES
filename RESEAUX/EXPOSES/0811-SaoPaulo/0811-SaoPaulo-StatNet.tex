%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A huge probabilistic literature ...}

Since the first works of \emphase{Erdös \& Rényi}, the
probabilistic properties of random graphs have been intensively
studied.

Typical quantities of interest are
\begin{itemize}
\itemv the node degrees (scale-free distribution?), 
\itemv the network diameter (small-world effect?),
\itemv the number of triangles and/or the clustering
  coefficient,
\itemv the number of connected components and the size
  of the largest one,
\itemv the spread of an epidemic or an innovation.
\end{itemize}
Numerous asymptotic and exact results are available, for large
classes of random graphs. \\
See \refer{PaR07} for a general review on random graph models.

\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip
\subsection{Expected degree distribution (EDD) model}

\paragraph{Model.} Expected degrees $\{D_i\}$ are i.i.d. with \emphase{given
  degree distribution} (e.g. the empirical degree distribution of
$\Xcal_{\text{obs}}$),
$$
\{X_{ij}\} \text{ independent } | \{D_i\}, \quad X_{ij}|(D_i, D_j)
\sim \Bcal(\pi_{ij}), \qquad \pi_{ij} = \lambda D_i D_j
$$
with $\lambda^{-1} = (n-1) \Esp D_i$ to ensure $\Esp(K_i | D_i) =
D_i$. \\

\paragraph{(Basic) model.} \refer{BaA99}
\begin{itemize}
\itemv Starting from $m_0 \geq m$ initial nodes.
\itemv Nodes \emphase{enter the network one by one}.
  Let $K_i^j$ denote the degree of node $i$ at 'time' $j$ (i.e.  when
  the network has size $j$):
  $$
  K_i^j = \sum_{\ell=1}^j X_{i\ell},
  $$
\itemv Node $j+1$ is connected to \emphase{$m$ older
    nodes}, with probability proportional to their current degree
  (\emphase{rich-get-richer}):
  $$
  \Pr\{X_{i, j+1} = 1\} \propto K_i^j, 
  $$
  i.e. the connexions of node $j+1$ are sampled among the $j$
  preceeding nodes with \emphase{unequal probabilities} ($\propto
  K_i^j$) and \emphase{without replacement}.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{Properties.}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemv Degrees have a \emphase{power-law} (\emphase{scale-free})
  distribution:
  $$
  p(k) \propto m^2/k^3
  $$
  (which is not defined for $k=0$)
\itemv Sub-sample of 'scale-free' networks are not scale-free (\refer{SWM05}).

    \\
    However, inference is generally focused on the \emphase{exponent
      $\alpha$} such that $p(k) \propto k^{-\alpha}$. \\
    \\
    The assessment of the scale-free distribution and the estimation of
    $\alpha$ are often based on the \emphase{log-log plot} of the

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Model.} Denoting $\Xbf = \{x_{ij}\}_{i, j}$:
$$
\Pr\{\Xbf = \xbf\} \propto \exp g(\xbf; \gammabf), 
\qquad \text{where } g(\xbf; \gammabf) = \sum \gamma_a s_a(\xbf)
$$
where the $s_a$ are \emphase{(sufficient) statistics}, associated
with parameters $\gammabf = (\gamma_a)$ (\refer{PaR07}, also called
\emphase{'P$^*$' models}).
%PaR07-SAGE.pdf

\bigskip
\paragraph{Typical statistics:} Number of edges, $\mathsf{V}$, triangles, etc.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Simulation.} Simulation of ERMG is not straightforward,
particularly because of the normalising constant. A
\emphase{Metropolis-Hastings algorithm} can be used where, at each
  step:
\begin{itemize}
\itemv $\xbf$ is transformed into $\xbf'$ by switching a randomly chosen
  edge: $x'_{ij} = 1 - x_{ij}$;
\itemv  $\xbf$ is replaced by $\xbf'$ with probability $\min \left(1,
  \exp\left\{ \sum_a \gamma_a [s_a(\xbf') - s_a(\xbf)] \right\} \right)$.

\subsection{Pseudo-Likelihood}

\paragraph{MLE.} The maximisation of the log-likelihood
$$
\Lcal(\xbf; \gammabf) = g(\xbf; \gammabf) - \log \sum_{\xbf'} \exp
g(\xbf'; \gammabf)
$$
is intractable, mainly because of the normalizing constant.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Pseudo-MLE.} The idea is to approximate $\Lcal(\xbf;
\gammabf)$ (\refer{WaP96}):
$$
\Lcal(\xbf; \gammabf) \approx \log\left(\prod_{ij} \Pr\{X_{ij}=x_{ij}
  | \Cbf_{ij}\} \right)
$$
where $\Cbf_{ij}$ stands for the complementary of $X_{ij}$ in the
graph $\Xbf$: $\Cbf_{ij} = \Xbf \setminus X_{ij}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Conditional distribution of one edge.} Denoting
\begin{itemize}
\itemv $\Xbf_{ij}^+$ the graph $\Xbf$ where $X_{ij}$ is set to 1,
\itemv $\Xbf_{ij}^-$ the graph $\Xbf$ where $X_{ij}$ is set to 0,
\end{itemize}
$\begin{array}{lcl}
  \text{we have} \qquad 
\logit~\Pr\{X_{ij} = 1 | \Cbf_{ij}\} & = &   \log
  \left(\Pr\{\Xbf_{ij}^+\} / \Pr\{\Xbf_{ij}^-\} \right) \\
  \\
  & = & g(\Xbf_{ij}^-; \gammabf) - g(\Xbf_{ij}^+; \gammabf) \\
  \\
  & = & \sum_a \gamma_a [s_a(\Xbf_{ij}^+) - s_a(\Xbf_{ij}^-)].
\end{array}$

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Logistic regression.} ERGM pseudo-MLE of $\gammabf$ is
hence equivalent to MLE estimate of a logistic regression with covariates
$$
\xi_{ij, a} = s_a(\Xbf_{ij}^+) - s_a(\Xbf_{ij}^-).
$$
\refer{LuS07} mention that the pseudo-likelihood works well in
practice but seems to underestimate the variance of the estimates.

\subsection{(Monte Carlo) Maximum Likelihood}

step:

\paragraph{Likelihood.} Since the history of the network is not
observed, the likelihood is a \emphase{sum over all possible paths}
that could give raise to the observed network.

Direct ML can not be achieved.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{ABC inference.} A \emphase{likelihood-free} approach for an
observed network $\xbf$, consists in
\begin{itemize}
\itemv Defining a set $S$ of statistics, e.g.: number of edges,
  $\mathsf{V}$, triangles, etc.;
\itemv Sampling a value for parameter $\theta$ from a given prior;
\itemv Simulating a random network $\Xbf$ with same size as $\xbf$ xith
  parameter $\theta$;
\itemv Accepting $\theta$ if $\Xbf$ is similar to $\xbf$ in terms of $S$.
\end{itemize}

This sampling scheme provides an estimate of the
conditional distribution
$$
P(\theta | d[S(\xbf), S(\theta)] \leq \varepsilon)
\overset{?}{\approx}
P(\theta | \xbf).
$$

\paragraph{Remarks.}
\begin{enumerate}
\itemv The proposed algorithm looks like a Metropolis-Hastings for a
  \emphase{ERGM with same statistics $S$ and fixed parameter
    $\gammabf$} (summarised in the choice of the distance).
\itemv The calculation of the statistics $S$ for each simulated graph
  remains an \emphase{algorithmic issue}.

% To study the relative importance of aspects of duplication
% divergence in network evolution between different domains,
% we simulated the evolutionary history of PINs with a mixture
% of duplication divergence with parentchild attachment
% (DDa) and preferential attachment (PA); see Box 1. At each
% step, the network either grows according to DDa with
% probability 1  a or PA with probability a. More precisely,
% let Gt be a network with t nodes (proteins), v a new node, u a
% randomly chosen parent node in Gt, dDiv the divergence
% probability, dAtt the parentchild attachment probability, and
% let h ¼ (dDiv, dAtt, a). Then the probability of Gtþ1 conditional
% on Gt and u is
% PðGtþ1jGt; u; hÞ ¼ aPAðu; vÞ þ ð1  aÞDDaðu; v; dDiv; dAttÞ: ð1Þ
% The terms PA(u, v) and DDa(u, v, dDiv, dAtt) correspond to
% the probabilities of moving to the new configuration under PA and DDa, respectively. They are explained in Box 1 and
% defined fully in Protocol S1. By repeated application of the
% mechanism in Equation 1, we grew PINs to the approximate
% number of open reading frames in the respective genomes (H.
% pylori: 1,500, and P. falciparum: 5,300).

\paragraph{Model.} 
\refer{HRH02}
% HRH02-JASA.pdf, 
\begin{itemize}
\itemv Each node has a \emphase{(unknown) position $\Zbf_i$ in a latent
  space} (euclidian, e.g. $\Rbb^d$):
  $$
  \{\Zbf_i\} \text{ i.i.d.} \sim F \qquad(\text{e.g. } F = \Ncal(\Obf,
  \Sigmabf)). 
  $$
\itemv Edges $\{X_{ij}\}_{i, j}$ are independent, conditionally on
  $\{Z_i\}$: 
  $$
  X_{ij} \sim \Bcal(\pi_{ij}), 
  \qquad \logit(\pi_{ij}) = a + \|\Zbf_i -
  \Zbf_j\|. 
  $$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Covariates can be added:}
$
\qquad
\displaystyle{\log\left(\frac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}}\right) = a +
  \xibf_{ij} \thetabf + \|\Zbf_i - \Zbf_j\|}.
$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{Identifiability.} The estimation of $\Zcal = \{\Zbf_{ij}\}$
is a \emphase{Multidimensional Scaling} problem, that is not
identifiable. \refer{HRH02} use a Procustean trick to select each
configuration.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Inference.} The authors adopt a Bayesian strategy using a
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm including conditional sampling steps
\begin{enumerate}
\itemv $\widehat{\Zcal} | (\widehat{a}, \widehat{\thetabf})$,
\itemv $(\widehat{a}, \widehat{\thetabf}) | \widehat{\Zcal}$.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Remarks.} 
\begin{itemize}
\itemv A frequentist approach could work, using an E-M strategy but the
  sampling of $\widehat{\Zcal} | (\widehat{a}, \widehat{\thetabf})$
  would probably require a Monte-Carlo step.
\itemv New version of the model and of the algorithm: \refer{HRT07}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Mixture model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Model.} Each node has an \emphase{unobserved label} $Z_i$:
$$
\{Z_i\}_i \mbox{ i.i.d.}, \qquad Z_i \sim \Mcal(1; \alphabf)
$$
where $\alphabf = (\alpha_1, \dots \alpha_Q)$; The values of the edges
$\{X_{ij}\}_{i, j}$ are conditionally independent given the $Z_i$'s:
$$
(X_{ij} \;|\; Z_i = q, Z_j = \ell) \sim f_{q\ell}(\cdot).
$$
where $f_{q\ell}(\cdot)$ is some parametric distribution
$f_{q\ell}(x) = f(x; \theta_{q\ell})$. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Problem}

\noindent Describe the influence of covariates on the
presence/absence or the values of the edges.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Example for social network.} For a network describing
social relations between students $i = 1, ..., n$, one observe for
student $i$ the vector of covariates
$$
\xibf_i = (\xi_{i1}, ...,  \xi_{ip})
\qquad = \text{e.g. (Age, Class, Sex, Mean score level)}.
$$
       
\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Symmetrisation problem.} The variables to be explained are
the edges $\{X_{ij}\}$, so we need to \emphase{associate covariates
  with each edge}, e.g.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \text{Distance defined a priori:} \quad \xibf_{ij} & = & \| \xibf_i -
  \xibf_j\| \\
  \text{Symmetrised variables:} \quad \xi_{ij, m} & = & |\xi_{i, m} -
  \xi_{j, m}|
\end{eqnarray*}
       
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Generalised (Mixed) Linear Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Logistic regression for binary network.} The connexion
probability depends on covariates \emphase{associated with the edge
  ($ij$)}:
$$
\{X_{ij}\}_{i < j} \text{ independent}, 
\qquad X_{ij} \sim \Bcal(\pi_{ij}),
\qquad \log\left(\frac{\pi_{ij}}{1 - \pi_{ij}}\right) = \xibf_{ij}'
\thetabf 
$$
where $\xibf_{ij}$ is vector of covariates and $\thetabf$ the vector of
parameters.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Mixed logistic regression.} A \emphase{random node effect}
can be added to account for the dependency between edges linked to a
same node:
$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_{ij}}{1 - \pi_{ij}}\right) = \xibf_{ij}' \thetabf
+ U_i + U_j, 
\qquad \{U_i\}_i \text{ i.i.d. } \sim \Ncal(0,
\gamma^2).
$$

\itemv Maximum likelihood using Newton-Raphson optimisation 
\itemv E-M algorithm (or some stochastic version: SAEM).

\paragraph{Protein function.} Given a protein-protein interaction

some proteins (nodes), can we predict the label ($Z_i$ ) of the
'unknown' proteins (\refer{CDR07}).

\paragraph{Frequency based approach.} Denoting $Z_i$, the unknown 
label of node $i$:
$$
\widehat{\Pr}\{Z_{iq}\} \propto \sum_{j: \text{ known } Z_j} X_{ij} Z_{jq}
$$
\paragraph{Improvements.} 
\begin{itemize}
\itemv Account for the association with other characteristics;
\itemv Account for triangular frequencies.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Performances} can be evaluated via \emphase{cross-validation}.

\subsection{Shrinkage}

\bigskip
\paragraph{Various strategies} have been proposed to \emphase{cope with the
  singularity} of $\Ybf'\Ybf$ (more precisely: $\Sbf = (\Ybf -
\overline{\Ybf})' (\Ybf - \overline{\Ybf})$). All are implicitly based
on the hypothesis that \emphase{$\Pbf$ is sparse}.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Shrinkage.}
\refer{ScS05} propose to use the invert of
$$
\Sbf^* = (1- \lambda) \Sbf + \lambda \Tbf, 
$$
where $\lambda$ is \emphase{shrinkage coefficient} toward a target
matrix $\Tbf$ and provide the \emphase{optimal $\lambda$ in terms of
  MSE}.
% ScS05-SAGMB.pdf

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Multiple testing.} Once \emphase{shrinked partial
  correlation $p^*_{ij}$} are obtained, a test has to be applied to
provide a threshold so that only significant ones finally kept.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{LASSO}

\bigskip
\paragraph{Penalised regression.} \refer{MeB06} suggest to infer
variables having an direct influence on $Y_i$ using \emphase{linear
  regression}. To account for singularity and sparsity, they use the
LASSO penalised least square estimate:
$$
\thetabf_i = \underset{\thetabf}{\arg \min} \| \Ybf_i - \Ybf_{\setminus
  i} \thetabf_i\|^2_2 + \lambda \|\thetabf_i\|_1.
$$
\begin{itemize}
\itemv The LASSO penalty can viewed as a Laplace prior on the
  regression coefficents in a Bayesian setting.
\itemv Consistancy results  for the set of non-zero terms
  of $\Wbf$ are shown.
\end{itemize}
% MeB06-AnnStat.pdf

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Penalised covariance.} \refer{BEA08} (and
\refer{ACM08}) suggest to use the same strategy but to
\emphase{directly penalise the inverse covariance matrix $\Wbf$}:
$$
\widehat{\Wbf} = \underset{\Wbf}{\arg \min} - \log |\Wbf| +
\text{tr}(\Sbf \Wbf) + \lambda \|\Wbf\|_1.
$$
(see \refer{VSB07} for a comparative study.)
