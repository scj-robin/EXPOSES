Uncovering structure in biological interaction networks

Networks are a natural way to describe the interaction between biological entities (genes, species, etc…). Flexible random graphs models are needed to describe the wide variety to topologies displayed by such networks. Stochastic block models have become a popular way to describe such topologies. These models are mixture models, the inference of which raises several statistical issues. We will present several advances such as some refinement of variational approximations, a variational Bayes inference or the introduction of covariates to explain the network structure. These results will be illustrated with application to molecular and ecological networks.
