Goodness of fit for logistic regression in random graphs: a (variational) Bayes approach

Interaction networks are commonly used in various fields, from ecology to social sciences to describe the relations between a set of entities such as species or individuals. In many applications, covariates are also available, that describe phylogenetic proximities or social similarities between the entities. A natural question is then to understand to what extent covariates contribute to explain the topology of the network.
To this aim we define a generic network model that combines logistic regression on the covariates with graphon-type residual term. More specifically, we infer the residual graphon using a mixture of stochastic block models, which enables us to (i) estimate the covariate effects, (ii) test the existence of a residual structure (i.e. assess goodness-of-fit of the logistic regression) and (iii) visualize the residual structure.
In all this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective, for which we first propose a variational Bayes (VB) inference strategy. We then show how the VB approximate posterior can be used as a starting point for bridge sampling toward the true posterior.
