Introduction
    Network
    Network / graph
    Observed
    Not observed
Network inference: a brief introduction
    Problem
    Joint statistical model
    Graphical model (Interaction =  conditional dependence)
    Gaussian graphical models
    Precision matrix
    Graphical lasso
Network inference from count data
    No canonical multivariate distribution
    Model with hidden latent layer
    Inference issue: latent = not observed
    A statistical model: PLN
Network analysis: looking for a structure
    Problem
    Statistical model for network
    A statistical model: Stochastic block model
Network analysis: null models
Some perspectives: 
    Network inference via edge prediction (supervised classification)
    Analysis of an inferred network (account for edge uncertainty)
    Hypergraphs
