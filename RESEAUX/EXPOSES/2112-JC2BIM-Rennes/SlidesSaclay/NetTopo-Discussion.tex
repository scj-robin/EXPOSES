  but some are useful

  \paragraph{Statistical models} can be useful
  \begin{itemize}
   \item to exhibit latent structure
   \item to correct for expected effects (e.g. covariates) and enhanced unexpected ones
   \item to serve as (not too) null model to be compared with observation (and to exhibit some {\sl residual} structure)
  \end{itemize}
  \ra Always tailored for a given purpose (no generic model)

  \bigskip \bigskip \pause
  \paragraph{'Null model'} sometimes refers to resampled-based null distribution:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item appealing because (reasonably) easy to implement
   \item appealing because no distribution assumption seems to be made
   \item confusing because underlying assumptions are not always explicit
  \end{itemize}
