Dear all,
On behalf of the local organizer, Anuska Ferligoj, I am really pleased to welcome you next week in Ribno, Slovenia, for the first COSTNET Action conference on Statistical Network Science. We are looking forward to kick-off the Action and spend the next four years thinking about the (possible) convergence of various network inference approaches in different sub-disciplines. 

Some practical info: 

    The conference will be held in Ribno Hotel, Bled.
    For transfers from the airport to the conference are cheapest (up to 1st order approximation) via GOOPTI, which should be booked in advance: https://www.goopti.com/en/
    For those that arrive on Tuesday 20 September BEFORE 14:30 (!): our sister meeting, the Applied Statistics conference (http://conferences.nib.si/AS2016/), offers the COSTNET participants to join the Social Tour to Ljubljana free of charge (depending on the available seats) leaving at 14:30 on Tuesday 20 September from Ribno Hotel and returning around 8pm.  
    All practical info can be found at:

    Scientific programme is attached. 

Looking forward to meeting you all in Ribno next week!

Best,
Ernst
