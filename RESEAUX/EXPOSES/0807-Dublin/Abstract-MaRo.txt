\begin{abstract} As more and more network-structured datasets are
available, the statistical analysis of valued graphs has become a
common place. Looking for a latent structure is one of the many
strategies used to better understand the behavior of a
network. Several methods already exist for the binary case. \\
We present a model-based strategy to uncover groups of nodes in
valued graphs. This framework can be used for a wide span of
parametric random graphs models. Variational tools allow us to
achieve approximate maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters
of these models. We provide a simulation study showing that our
estimation method performs well over a broad range of situations.
