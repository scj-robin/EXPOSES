\chapter{Random graph}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Notation and definition.} Given a set of $n$ vertices ($i = 1..n$),
$X_{ij}$ indicates the presence/absence of a (non oriented) edge
between vertices $i$ and $j$:
$$
X_{ij} = X_{ji} = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{rl}
    1 & \mbox{if } i \leftrightarrow j, \\
    0 & \mbox{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\qquad X_{ii} = 0.
$$
The random graph is defined by the join distribution of all the
edges $\{X_{ij}\}_{i, j}$.

\vspace{1cm}
\paragraph{Typical characteristics.} 

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Degree (connectivity) of the vertices: & ${K_i = \sum_{j
      \neq i} X_{ij}}$ \\
  \\
  Clustering coefficient: &  ${c = \Pr\{X_{jk} = 1 \;|\;
    X_{ij} = X_{ik} = 1 \}}$ \\
  \\
  Diameter: & Longest path between two vertices.
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Erdös-Rényi (ER) model}

\paragraph{Definition.} The $\{X_{ij}\}_{i, j}$ are i.i.d.: 
$$
X_{ij} \sim \Bcal(p).  
$$

\paragraph{Characteristics.}

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Degree: & $K_i \sim \Bcal(n-1, p) \approx \Pcal(\lambda)$ \\
  \\
  Clustering coefficient: &  ${c = p}$ \\
\end{tabular}


\vspace{1cm}
\paragraph{Drawback.} The ER fits poorly many real-world networks.
\begin{itemize}
\item Empirical degree distributions are often very different from the
  Poisson distribution because of few vertices having very high
  degrees.
\item Empirical clustering coefficients are generally higher than
  expected under ER.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\chapter{Mixture model for the degrees} \label{Sec:PoissonMixture}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Scale-free distribution.} The most popular alternative to
the Poisson distribution is the Zipf distribution:
$$
\Pr\{K = k\} = c(\rho)k^{-(\rho+1)},
$$
where $\rho > 0$ and $c(\rho)$ is a normalizing constant. (Not
defined for $k = 0$.)

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Mixture model.} We propose to generalize the ER model
assuming that the vertices belong to $Q$ different groups with
different mean degrees $\lambda_q$. 

We denote $\alpha_q$ the prior probability (proportion) of each group
$$
\alpha_q = \Pr\{i \in q\}, 
\quad 
\sum_q \alpha_q = 1
$$
and $Z_{iq}$ the binary variable indicating if vertex $i$ belongs
to group $q$:
$
Z_{iq} = \Ibb\{i \in q\}.
$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{Distribution of the degrees.} $K$ has a mixture
distribution
$$
K \sim \sum_q \alpha_q \Pcal(\lambda_q)
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
\Pr \{ K = k \}= \sum_{q=1}^Q \alpha_q \frac{e^{-\lambda_q} \lambda_q^k}{k!}.
$$

\subsection{An explicit random graph model} 

\paragraph{Mixture population of vertices.} We still suppose that the
vertices belong to $Q$ groups:
$$
\alpha_q = \Pr\{i \in q\}, 
\qquad
Z_{iq} = \Ibb\{i \in q\}.
$$

\paragraph{Conditional distribution of the edges.}
The edges $\{X_{ij}\}$ are conditionally independent given the group of
the vertices:
$$
X_{ij} \; |\; \{i \in q, j \in \ell \} \sim \Bcal(\pi_{q\ell}).
$$
$\pi_{q\ell} = \pi_{\ell q}$ is the connection probability between
groups $q$ and $\ell$.

A high value of $\pi_{q\ell}$ reveals a preferential connectivity
between groups $q$ and $\ell$.

\paragraph{Conditional distribution of the degrees:}
$
K_i \;|\; \{i \in q \} \sim \Bcal(n-1, \pibar_q) \approx
\Pcal(\lambda_q)
$
where $ \pibar_q = \sum_{\ell} \alpha_{\ell} \pi_{q\ell}$,
$\lambda_q = (n-1) \pibar_q$.

\bigskip
\paragraph{Marginal distribution = mixture:}
$$ K_i \sim \sum_q \alpha_q \Bcal(n-1, \pibar_q) \approx \sum_q \alpha_q
\Pcal(\lambda_q).  $$

\bigskip
\paragraph{Between-group connectivity.}
$A_{q\ell}$ denotes the connectivity between groups $q$ and $\ell$:
$$
A_{q\ell} = \sum_{i<j} Z_{iq} Z_{j\ell} X_{ij}, 
\qquad
\Esp (A_{q\ell})  = n(n-1) \alpha_q \alpha_{\ell} \pi_{q\ell} \left/ 2
  \right..
$$

\bigskip
\paragraph{Clustering coefficient:}  
$$
c = \Pr\{\nabla \;|\; \Vsf\} = \Pr\{\nabla\} /
\Pr\{\Vsf\} = \frac{\sum_{q, \ell, m} \alpha_q \alpha_{\ell} \alpha_m
  \pi_{q\ell} \pi_{qm} \pi_{\ell m}}{\sum_{q, \ell, m} \alpha_q
  \alpha_{\ell} \alpha_m \pi_{q\ell} \pi_{qm}}.
$$


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\chapter{Maximum likelihood estimation via E-M}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We denote $\Xcal = \{X_{ij}\}_{i, j = 1..n}$, $\Zcal=
\{Z_{iq}\}_{i=1..n, q=1..Q}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Likelihood}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood is
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \Qcal(\Xcal) &=& \Esp \left\{ \Lcal(\Xcal,\Zcal)|\Xcal \right\}  \\
  \\
  &=&  \sum_i \sum_q \tau_{iq} \log \alpha_q
  + \sum_i \sum_q \sum_{j > i} \sum_{\ell} \theta_{ijq\ell} \log
  b(X_{ij}; \pi_{q\ell}),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\tau_{iq}$ and $\theta_{ijq\ell}$ are {\it posterior}
probabilities
$$
\tau_{iq} = \Pr\{Z_{iq} = 1 \;|\; \Xcal\}, \qquad
\theta_{ijq\ell} = \Pr\{Z_{iq} Z_{j\ell} = 1 \;|\; \Xcal\}
$$
% \begin{eqnarray*}
%   \tau_{iq} & = & \Pr\{Z_{iq} = 1 \;|\; \Xcal\} = \Esp(Z_{iq} \;|\;
%   \Xcal), \\
%   \\
%   \theta_{ijq\ell} & = & \Pr\{Z_{iq} Z_{j\ell} = 1 \;|\; \Xcal\} =
%   \Esp(Z_{iq} Z_{j\ell} \;|\; \Xcal). 
% \end{eqnarray*}
Evaluating these probabilities is not straightforward because the
$\{Z_{iq}\}$ are all dependent conditionally on $\Xcal$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{E step: Mean field approximation.}
We approximate the conditional joint distribution of the $\{Z_{iq}\}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \Pr\{\Zcal \;|\; \Xcal\} & \simeq & \prod_i \Pr\{\Zcal_i \;|\; \Xcal,
  \Zcal^i\} \\
  \quad \mbox{where} \quad
  \Pr\{Z_{iq} = 1 \;|\; \Xcal, \Zcal^i\} & \propto & \alpha_q \prod_{m}
  b(C_{im}; N^i_{m} , \pi_{qm})
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item The elements of $\Zcal^i$ are estimated by their conditional
  expectation: $ \widehat{Z}_{j\ell} = \tau_{j\ell}$.
\item The posterior probabilities $\tau_{iq}$ must therefore satisfy 
  $$
  \widehat{\tau}_{iq} = \Pr\{Z_{iq} = 1 \;|\; \Xcal,
  \widehat{\Zcal}^i\} 
  $$
  which is actually a fix point type relation.  The
  $\widehat{\tau}_{iq}$ are obtained by iterating it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{M step.}
Maximizing $\Qcal(\Xcal)$ subject to $\sum_q \alpha_q = 1$ gives
$$
\widehat{\alpha}_q = \sum_i \widehat{\tau}_{iq} / n, \qquad
\widehat{\pi}_{q\ell} = \sum_i \sum_j \widehat{\theta}_{ijq\ell}
X_{ij} \left/ \sum_i \sum_j \widehat{\theta}_{ijq\ell} \right..
$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Choice of the number of groups}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We propose a heuristic penalized likelihood criterion inspired from
BIC.

Since $\Qcal(\Xcal)$ is the sum of
$$
\begin{tabular}{p{11cm}p{13cm}}
  $\displaystyle{\sum_i \sum_q \tau_{iq} \log \alpha_q}$ & 
  which deals with $(Q-1)$ independent proportions $\alpha_q$s and
  involves $n$ terms, 
  \\ 
  \\
  $\displaystyle{\sum_i \sum_q \sum_{j > i} \sum_{\ell} \theta_{ijq\ell} \log
    b(X_{ij}; \pi_{q\ell})}$ 
  & which deals with $Q(Q+1)/2$ probabilities $\pi_{q\ell}$s and
  involves $n(n-1)/2$ terms,
\end{tabular}
$$
we propose the following heuristic criterion:
$$
  - 2\Qcal(\Xcal) + (Q-1) \log n + Q(Q+1)/2 \log[n(n-1)/2].
$$

\chapter{Conclusions}

\paragraph{Past.} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} The ERMG model is a flexible generalization of
  the ER model and a promising alternative to the scale-free 'model'.
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} It seems to fit well several real-world networks
  %(Airport network, Enzyme network in bacteria, etc.).
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} It is properly defined, so its properties can be
  properly studied.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Future.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} Study the probabilistic properties of the ERMG
  model (diameter, probability for a subgraph to be connected, etc).
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} Derive a relevant criterion to select the number
  of groups.
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} Extension to valued graphs: $X_{ij}$ not only
  0/1, but some measure of the connection intensity.
\end{itemize}
