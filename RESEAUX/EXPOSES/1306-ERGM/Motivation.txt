For several years, I have been interested in various random graph models, mostly to describe network heterogeneities. I have developped several methods for the stochastic block model (SBM), which is a state space model for graphs assuming that the topology of the graph is governed by some unobserved structure. I am interested in variational approximations for the inference of such models. I would be interested in better understanding the connexions between SBM and exponential random graph models (ERGM), which I suspect to exist.
