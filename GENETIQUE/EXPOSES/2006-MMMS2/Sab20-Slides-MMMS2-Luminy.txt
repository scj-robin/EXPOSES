#7= LD conserved across population ?
Does it affect replicability

#7= Height example, how are build the SNP groups? Why do they overlap.

16:20= dummy variable with same joint Gaussian distribution ? Gaussian OK for SNP ?

18:00= reminder on knock-off (22:00 : reminder on knock-off construction)

Knockoff copies of a Markov chain
* building of the knock-off sample not always feasible, but doable for Markov model => LD only due to physical proximity
* how robust is the method to the preservation of the dependency structure?

Correlation and power 
#31 "higher power when Xt_2 less correlated with X_2": 
* what is the intuition behind this?
* how to force this when creating the knock-off sample?

Group hypotheses and group knockoffs
#37
* how to build the groups? Which hierarchical clustering algo?
* Is the HC algo necessarily consistent with SNP location along the genome

Posted:
+ If I understand correctly slide #31, there is a relation between a low correlation between X_2 and \tilde{X}_2, and the power. Could you give an intuition for this?

+ More generally, linkage disequilibrium (LD) may display complex patterns, that do not fit the Markov assumption. How robust is the proposed approach to such departures? (for statistical the audience, we may recall that LD just means correlation)

* One purpose of knock-off is to guaranty the replicability of the results across studies. Does it also mean across populations? What if the LD structure varies from one population to another or the LD structure is due to the existence of sub-populations? 

+ The group knock-off approach is very nice and states the genetic association studies on large data set in a sensible way. Building the blocks is certainly both delicate and critical. Could you comment on this? Is the clustering algorithm required to be consistent with ordering of the loci along the genome? 

It times permits
+ You propose a strategy to build a knock-off sample for genetic studies, relying on a Markov dependency. Do you account for the actual genetic distance between neighbor loci?
