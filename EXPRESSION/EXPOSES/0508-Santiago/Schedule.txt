I'm really impressed by such an organization. I had my answers /
comments / questions within the program.

Thank you so much for everything. My last stay in Chile was already
splendid. Hospitality seems to be a real a national specialty.

Regards, 

Stéphane

Do you want me to give the same talk twice (one at the PUC and once at
the worlshop)? If so, no problem for me.

Practical sessions for experimental design are difficult to
organize. We could try to examine some real examples or discuss some
typical experiments in which people attending the workshop are
involved. The latter is probably the most risky but also the most
interesting for everyone. It strongly depends on the people to be
there.

I can send you some examples we present to our students which each
consist in 1 datafile + 1 SAS program. Which statistical software do
you intend to use. R is probably the most convenient but,
unfortunately, it's not my favorite. Do you have some local R expert
who could lead this practical exercises?

Same as for differential analysis.
