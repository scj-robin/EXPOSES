\subsection{Model = Reference} \\
To be able to decide if something is \emphase{unexpected}, one
first need to know \emphase{what to expect}

\item The model must be \emphase{well fitted} to the data to avoid artifacts and
  non-interesting discoveries
\item but \emphase{not too well} fitted to let unexpected events
  happen

\emphase{Interesting} cases are revealed when the model is (very)
\emphase{wrong}

The choice of the model depends on the problem

\emphase{Theoretically}, properties derived under M1 can be

\subsection{Principle for a motif} 
\qquad \qquad {\sl R. \& Daudin, 01} (M1) 

Consider the distribution of the occurrences of the motif 
$$
\mbf = \{\wbf_1, \dots, \wbf_I\}
$$
The distribution of the distances \emphase{depends on the
  words} themselves

      width=25cm, bbllx=75, bblly=255 , bburx=520 , bbury=350 , clip=}
    }
$$

Steps 1, 2, 3 follow the same principle as for one word but involve
\emphase{generating matrices}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
Denoting $\phi_{ij}(t) = \phi_{Y_{ij}}(t)$, ($i, j = 1..I$)
$$
\underset{I \times I}{\Phibf(t)} = \left[ 
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    \phi_{11}(t) & \dots & \phi_{1I}(t) \\
    \vdots       &       & \vdots       \\
    \phi_{I1}(t) & \dots & \phi_{II}(t) \\
  \end{array}
\right], 
\qquad \phi_{ij}(t) = \frac{U_{ij}(t)}{V_{ij}(t)}
$$

Step 2 requires the \emphase{inversion} of a generating matrix:
$$
\Phibf(t) = {\bf F}(t)[{\bf I} - {\bf F}(t)]^{-1}
$$
\vspace{0.5cm}
\paragraph{Limitations:}
\vspace{-1cm}
\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$] 
\item \emphase{Complexity} of this last step: \emphase{$O(I^3
    |\mbf|)$}
\item \emphase{Numerical instability} except if $[{\bf I} -
  {\bf F}(t)]$ is inverted formally \\
  $\Longrightarrow$ small set of short words (small $I$ and
  $|\mbf|$)
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Other approaches} 
\vspace{-1cm}

\item grammars: {\sl Nicodème, 00}

When considering one single word $\wbf$, the clump sizes have a

\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]

In the general case (e.g. \emphase{motif} $\mbf =\{\wbf_1$, $\wbf_2$,

One may use
\vspace{-1cm}

\section{Extremal statistics}
We are interested in the \emphase{richest} region, i.e.

Y^r_{\min} = \min_i \{Y_i^r\}\qquad \mbox{or} \qquad \Delta N_{\sup} = \sup_x \{\Delta N(x)\}

\subsection{Poisson approximation} \\
If the $\{Y_i^r\}$ or the $\{\Delta N(x)\}$ were \emphase{independent}
$$
\Pr\{Y^r_{\min} \leq y\} \underset{n \rightarrow
  \infty}{\longrightarrow} \exp[-(n-r)\Pr\{Y^r \leq y\}]

$$
\Pr\{\Delta N_{\sup} > n\} \underset{\ell \rightarrow

\newpage
\subsection{Chen-Stein method}\\
$\{Y_i^r\}$ and $\{\Delta N(x)\}$ are \emphase{not independent} but
the quality of the Poisson approximation can be controlled in total
variation distance ({\sl Arratia \& al, 89}):
$$
\max_y \left| \Pr\{Y^r_{\min} \leq y\} - e^{-(n-r)\Pr\{Y^r \leq y\}}\right|
\leq \mbox{bound}
$$

\paragraph{Cumulated distances:} an \emphase{explicit bound} can be calculated 
({\sl Dembo \& Karlin, 92})

\paragraph{Moving windows:} \emphase{no explicit bound} can be
derived, but this approximation is \emphase{optimal} ({\sl Barbour \&
  Brown, 92})

\section{Distribution in heterogeneous sequences} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Biological sequences are generally heterogeneous because of succession
of different ``states'' (coding / non-coding, $\gtt$-$\ttt$ content,
etc.)

\paragraph{Aim:} Account for this heterogeneity to avoid statistical
biases. 

\paragraph{Example:} $\gtt$-$\ttt$ rich motif are more frequent in
$\gtt$-$\ttt$ rich regions.

\paragraph{Prior information:} 
The segmentation of the sequence related to this heterogeneity is
often known \\
$\bullet \quad$ sequence annotations give coding / non-coding regions
\\
$\bullet \quad$ HMM provide a probabilistic segmentation based on the
sequence composition \\

\centerline{$\Longrightarrow \quad \pi_s(x) = \Pr\{\mbox{position } x \in \mbox{state
  } s\}$ \emphase{known a priori}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{Model:} \hspace{14cm} {\sl Ledent \& R., 03} 

$\bullet \quad$ Clump process $\{C(x)\}$ is an \emphase{heterogeneous Poisson} process with intensity
$$
\lambda(x) = \sum_s \lambda_s \pi_s(x)
$$
$\bullet \quad$ Clump sizes $\{K_c\}$ have heterogeneous
distributions:
$$
g(k \;|\; x) = \sum_s \pi_s(x) g_s(k)
$$
typically
$$
g(k \;|\; x) = \sum_s \pi_s(x) a_s^{k-1} (1-a_s)
$$

Once the parameters are estimated, the occurrences processes can be
\emphase{homogenized} and former techniques can be applied to the
homogenized data
