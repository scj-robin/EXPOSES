Using deterministic approximations to accelerate SMC for posterior sampling

Joint work with Sophie Donnet

The Stochastic Block-Model (SBM) has become one of the most popular tools for analysing the topology of interaction networks. It can be generalized to account for the effect of covariates on the intensity of the links between edges. Because of the intricate dependency structure, the statistical inference of SBM models raises a series of issues and most approaches rely on approximations, with few theoretical guarantees.
On the other hand, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has become a standard tool for Bayesian inference of complex models. This approach can be computationally demanding, especially when initialized from the prior distribution. 
We focus on a weighted version of the SBM model (including covariates). We propose a bridge sampling scheme starting from a deterministic approximation of the posterior distribution and targeting the true one. The resulting Shortened Bridge Sampler (SBS) relies on a sequence of distributions that is determined in an adaptive way.
We use of the proposed approach to analyse the organization of some ecological networks.
