abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose a test procedure for
                  the detection of differential alternative splicing
                  across conditions for tiling array or exon chip
                  data. While developed in a mixed model framework,
                  the test procedure is exact (avoiding computational
                  burden) and applicable to a large variety of
                  contrasts, including several previously published
                  ones. A simulation study is presented to evaluate
                  the robustness and performance of the method. It is
                  found to have a good detection power of genes under
                  differential alternative splicing, even for five
                  biological replicates and four probes per exon. The
                  methodology also enables the comparison of various
                  experimental designs through exact power
                  curves. This is illustrated with the comparison of
                  paired and unpaired experiments. The test procedure
                  was applied to two publicly available cancer data
                  sets based on exon arrays, and showed promising
                  results.},

TITLE = {Kerfdr: a semi-parametric kernel-based approach to local false discovery rate estimation},
JOURNAL = {BMC Bioinformatics},
VOLUME = {10},
YEAR = {2009},
NUMBER = {1},
PAGES = {84},
URL = {http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/84},

ISSN = {1471-2105},
ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The use of current high-throughput genetic,
                  genomic and post-genomic data leads to the
                  simultaneous evaluation of a large number of
                  statistical hypothesis and, at the same time, to the
                  multiple-testing problem. As an alternative to the
                  too conservative Family-Wise Error-Rate (FWER), the
                  False Discovery Rate (FDR) has appeared for the last
                  ten years as more appropriate to handle this
                  problem. However one drawback of FDR is related to a
                  given rejection region for the considered
                  statistics, attributing the same value to those that
                  are close to the boundary and those that are not. As
                  a result, the local FDR has been recently proposed
                  to quantify the specific probability for a given
                  null hypothesis to be true.RESULTS:In this context
                  we present a semi-parametric approach based on
                  kernel estimators which is applied to different
                  high-throughput biological data such as patterns in
                  DNA sequences, genes expression and genome-wide
                  association studies.CONCLUSION:The proposed method
                  has the practical advantages, over existing
                  approaches, to consider complex heterogeneities in
                  the alternative hypothesis, to take into account
                  prior information (from an expert judgment or
                  previous studies) by allowing a semi-supervised
                  mode, and to deal with truncated distributions such
                  as those obtained in Monte-Carlo simulations. This
                  method has been implemented and is available through
                  the R package kerfdr via the CRAN or at
                  http://stat.genopole.cnrs.fr/software/kerfdr
