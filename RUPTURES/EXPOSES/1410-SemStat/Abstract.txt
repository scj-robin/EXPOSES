Identifiabilité dans les modèles de Markov cachés. Application en génomique

Identifiability in Hidden Markov Models with Applications to Genomics

Like most models involving hidden variables, hidden Markov models raise identifiability issues. A common way to circumvent these issues is to restrict the shape of the emission distribution. Indeed, an independent mixture model with fully non-parametric emission distribution is not identifiable. We will present a general result showing that hidden Markov models are identifiable under general assumptions. This results allows us to consider a broad class of emission distributions such as mixture or non-parametric ones.

Hidden Markov models are very popular in genomics as many genomics data are collected along the genome, which can be seen as a time line. In the second part of the talk, we will introduce the problem of the joint detection of copy number variations (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). We will show that this analysis can be tackled using an HMM with mixtures as emission distributions. We will briefly discuss the balance between the flexibility offered by the previous identifiability and the behavior of the EM algorithm, often used for HMM inference.
