\paragraph{Model.} The observed signal $Y=(Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$ is such that :
$$
Y_t=\mu_k + E_t \ \ \ \  \mbox{ if position $t$ is in segment
$I_k=[t_{k-1}+1,t_{k}]$,}
$$
with $\{E_t\}$ i.i.d. $\sim \Ncal(0,\sigma^2)$ and $k=1,\ldots,K$.

%\vspace{-.2cm}

\paragraph{The parameters of this model are} $T  =  (t_1, ..., t_{K-1})$ and $\Theta  =
(\mu_1,\hdots,\mu_K,\sigma^2)$.


\paragraph{Parameter estimation by maximum likelihood}

$\rightarrow$ To find the breakpoints, we have to minimize
$\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{t \in I_k} (Y_t - \widehat{\mu}_k)^2.$

$\rightarrow$ impossible to explore all possible segmentations for
large $n$ and $K$.

$\rightarrow$ Solution: \emphase{dynamic programming} can be used
since the contrast to be minimized is additive in $K$.

\paragraph{Choice of $K$.} Model selection: Penalized
Log-Likelihood.

\paragraph{Example : comparing groups of patients}
To detect chromosomal aberrations associated with a specific
disease, we compare the profiles of healthy and disease patients, or
the profiles of group of patients with different prognosis.


\paragraph{Common breakpoints:} all patients within the same group have their breakpoints at the
same positions.\\
 This can be done with a generalization of the
model presented above but this is not relevant biologically.

\paragraph{Proposed model.}

$\rightarrow$ We allow patient-specific segmentation.

$\rightarrow$ \emphase{Assumption:} the profiles of patients within
a same group at same position are \emphase{correlated}.

\foilhead[-.5in]{}

\vspace{-0.5cm}

\paragraph{Model.} $Y_{g\ell t}$ denotes the observed logratio at position $t$
for patient $\ell$ within group $g$. We assume that
$$
Y_{g\ell t} = \mu_{g\ell k} + U_{gt} + E_{g\ell t} \qquad \mbox{if
position $t$ belongs to segment $I_{g\ell k}$}
$$
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $I_{g\ell k}$ is the $k$-th segment of patient
  $\ell$ from group $g$,
\item  $\mu_{g\ell k}$ is the mean signal in segment
  $I_{g\ell k}$,
\item  $U_{gt}$ is the random effect at position $t$ in
  group $g$: $\{U_{gt}\}$ independent, $U_{gt} \sim \Ncal(0,
  \sigma^2_g)$,
\item $E_{g\ell t}$ is the noise: $\{E_{g\ell t}\}$
  i.i.d. $\sim \Ncal(0, \sigma^2_0)$.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-.5cm}

$$
\Cov(Y_{g\ell t}, Y_{g'\ell' t'}) =  \sigma^2_g \quad \mbox{ if
  \textblue{same group $g$ and same position $t$}}.
$$


\paragraph{General model}
$$
\Ybf = \underset{\mbox{Covariates}}{\underbrace{\Xbf \thetabf}} +
\underset{\mbox{Segmentation}}{\underbrace{\Tbf \mubf}} +
\underset{\mbox{Random effect}}{\underbrace{\Zbf \Ubf}} + \Ebf
$$
with $\Ebf \sim \Ncal(\Obf, \Rbf)$, \emphase{$\Rbf$ diagonal}






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\chead{\large {Parameters estimation}} \foilhead[-.5in]{}



\paragraph{Direct maximisation of the likelihood.}
The distribution of $\Ybf$ is
$$
\Ybf \sim \Ncal(\Xbf \thetabf + \Tbf \mubf, \Vbf), \qquad
\mbox{where
  } \Vbf = \Zbf \Gbf \Zbf' + \Rbf.
$$
Because, $\Vbf$ is not diagonal, the direct maximisation of the
observed log-likelihood $\Lcal(\Ybf)$ leads to the minimisation of a
non additive contrast in $K$.

\centerline{Dynamic programming \emphase{can not be used} to
estimate
  $\Tbf$ and $\mubf$}




\paragraph{Idea.}
$$
\Ybf -\Xbf \thetabf - \Zbf \Ubf \; | \; \Ubf \sim \Ncal(\Tbf \mubf,
\Rbf).
$$
$\Rbf$ is diagonal so the contrast to be minimized is additive in
$K$.

\centerline{\emphase{Dynamic programming can be used to estimate
    $\Tbf$ and $\mubf$}}

\paragraph{E-M strategy.} (used by Foulley (Lecture note, 2004) for mixed linear models) the
unobserved effect $\Ubf$ is predicted.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\chead{\large {E-M algorithm}} \foilhead[-.5in]{}

\paragraph{Idea.} The model can be viewed as model with incomplete data
: \emphase{$U$ is hidden}.


\paragraph{Principle.}
In presence of incomplete data, the maximisation of $\Lcal(\Ybf)$ is
equivalent to the maximisation of the conditional expectation
$$
\Qcal = \Esp\left[\Lcal(\Ybf, \Ubf) \; | \; \Ybf \right] =
\underset{\mbox{$\Qcal_0$}}{\underbrace{\Esp\left[\Lcal(\Ybf| \Ubf)
\; | \; \Ybf \right]}} +
\underset{\mbox{$\Qcal_1$}}{\underbrace{\Esp\left[\Lcal(\Ubf) \; |
\; \Ybf \right]}}.
$$

Here we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
  -2\Qcal_0 & = & N\log(2 \pi \sigma^2_0) + \left [ \mbox{\rm Tr}\left[ \Zbf
  \Var(\Ubf|\Ybf) \Zbf'\right] + \|\Ybf - \Xbf\thetabf -
    \Tbf\mubf - \Zbf\Esp(\Ubf|\Ybf) \|^2  \right ] /\sigma^2_0 \\
  \\
  -2\Qcal_1 & = & \sum_g \left[M \log(2\pi\sigma^2_g) +
  \Esp(\Ubf_g'\Ubf_g | \Ybf)/\sigma^2_g \right].
\end{eqnarray*}


%& = & -\frac{1}{2} \left [ M \log(2\pi)+ \log(|\Gbf|)\right ]\\
%              &&-\frac{1}{2} M \text{Tr} \left(\Gbf^{-1}\left[ \ec{\Ubf} \ec{\Ubf}'+\vc{\Ubf} \right] \right)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\chead{\large {E-M algorithm }} \foilhead[-.5in]{}

\paragraph{E-step.} To calculate $\Qcal$, we need the following estimates
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \widehat{\Esp}(\Ubf|\Ybf) & = & \Gbf \Zbf' \Vbf^{-1} (\Ybf - \Xbf\thetabf -
  \Tbf\mubf)\\
  \widehat{\Var}(\Ubf|\Ybf) & = & \Gbf - \Gbf \Zbf' \Vbf^{-1} \Zbf
  \Gbf
\end{eqnarray*}

\vspace{-1cm}

where $\Vbf^{-1}$ is calculated using Henderson's trick.

\paragraph{M-step.} Denoting $\widehat{\Ubf} =
\widehat{\Esp}(\Ubf|\Ybf)$ , we get parameter estimates as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\sigma}^2_g & = & \arg\max_{\sigma^2_g} \Qcal_1, \\
\widehat{\sigma}^2_0 & = & \arg\max_{\sigma^2_0} \Qcal_0, \\
\widehat{\thetabf} & = & (\Xbf'\Xbf)^{-1} \Xbf'(\Ybf - \widehat{\Tbf
\mubf}
    -\Zbf \widehat{\Ubf}), \\
\widehat{\Tbf \mubf} & = & \arg\min_{\Tbf\mubf} \|\Ybf -
\Xbf\widehat{\thetabf}-{\Tbf\mubf}-\Zbf \widehat{\Ubf})\|^2.
\end{eqnarray*}

\vspace{-1cm}

The last maximisation (segmentation) is achieved thanks to dynamic
programming.

\chead{\large {Implementation strategies}} \foilhead[-.5in]{}


\paragraph{Segmentation step.} The  step is computationally
heavy. We use a two stage dynamic programming algorithm. \\

\paragraph{'Regular' EM.} During the M step, $\Qcal$ is supposed to
be maximised. The circular estimation of $\sigma^2_g, \sigma^2_0,
\thetabf$ and $\Tbf\mubf$ given $\widehat{\Ubf}$ and
$\widehat{\Var}(\Ubf|\Ybf)$ until convergence could achieve this
task, but it would requires \emphase{numerous dynamic programming
steps}
at each M step.\\

\paragraph{Proposed strategy.} To perform few dynamic programming
steps, we iterate the E step and the circular estimation of
$\sigma^2_g, \sigma^2_0$ and $\thetabf$ until convergence, before
updating $\widehat{\Tbf\mubf}$.\\
$\rightarrow$ this is a type of GEM strategy : $Q$ increases at each
step.\\

\paragraph{Numerical comparison.} The two algorithms give the
\emphase{same estimates}, but the proposed strategy is the
\emphase{most efficient} in terms of computational time.
