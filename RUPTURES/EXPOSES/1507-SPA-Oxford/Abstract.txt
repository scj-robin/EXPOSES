Recurrent genomic alterations and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck excursions

Genomic alterations can be associated with specific diseases such as certain cancer types. Such an association is declared significant when a sufficiently large alteration is observed in a sufficiently large fraction of patients carrying the disease. The significance of such a 'recurrent' alteration can be rephrased in terms of the length of the longest excursion of a certain process above a given threshold. Depending on the density of the loci observed along the genome of each patients and on the size of the cohort, different processes can be considered. 
We consider here the limit case where both the number of loci and the number of patients goes to infinity. We prove that the null model tends an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. We are then interested in the distribution of the longest excursion of an OU process, which is not known as this time for an arbitrary threshold. We derive an exact sampling scheme within this distribution. This scheme mostly consists in an importance sampling of the excursions of a Brownian motion.
