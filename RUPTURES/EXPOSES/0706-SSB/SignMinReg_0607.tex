\subsection{One patient} 

We are interested in patients for which $\Rcal$ occurs at some
position $t$. This depends on the number of successive aberrations
observed at the last $\ell$ positions.

\paragraph{Embedded Markov chain.} We define the embedded MC with
($\ell +1$) states $s = 0, \dots \ell$, where
$$
\text{\emphase{$s$ = number of '1' in the last $\ell$ positions.}}
$$
Denoting $p= \pi_{1, 1}$ and $q = \pi_{0, 0}$, the transition
matrix of the embedded MC is
$$
\left( 
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}
  & 0 & 1 & \dots  & s & \dots & \ell \\
  \hline
  0 & \pi_{0, 0} & \pi_{0, 1} & \\

  \vdots  & \vdots & & & \ddots \\
  s & \pi_{1, 0} & & & & \pi_{1, 1}  \\
  \vdots  & \vdots & & & & & \ddots \\
  \ell & \pi_{1, 0} & & & & & \pi_{1, 1}  
\end{array}
\right).
$$
\paragraph{$\Rcal$ occurs each time the MC visits state $\ell$.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage

\subsection{$m$ patients} 

We are now interested in the number of patients for which $\Rcal$ occurs
at position $t$. This depends on the number of successive aberrations
observed in \emphase{all patients} at the last $\ell$ position.

\paragraph{Counts.} Denote 
\begin{description}
\item[$M^0_t = $] \# {normal patients
    at position $t$}: $M^0_t = {\sum_i (1-X_{it})}$ 
\item[$M^s_t = $] \# {patients with aberrations at (exactly) the last $s$
    positions} ($1 \leq s \leq \ell$): $M^s_t = {\sum_i (1-X_{i, t-s})
    \prod_{u=1}^s X_{i, t-s+u}}$ 
\item[$M^{\ell}_t =$]\# {patients with aberrations at the last $\ell$
    positions: $M^{\ell}_t = Y_{+t} = {\sum_i \prod_{u=1}^{\ell} X_{i,
        t-s+u}}$}
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{Multivariate binomial process.} The distribution of the
counts at position $t+1$ given the counts at position $t$ is defined
as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M^1_{t+1} & \sim & \Bcal(M^0_t, \pi_{0, 1}), \\
  M^{s+1}_{t+1} & \sim & \Bcal(M^s_t, \pi_{1, 1}), \qquad \qquad \text{for } 1 \leq
  s \leq \ell-2 \\
  M^{\ell}_{t+1} & \sim & \Bcal(M^{\ell-1}_t + M^{\ell}_t, \pi_{1,
  1}), \\
  M^0_{t+1} & = & M - \sum_{s=1}^{\ell} M^s_{t+1}. \\

    The process $\{(M^0_t, \dots, M^{\ell}_t)\}$ is a first order Markov

\paragraph{Numbered of altered patients.} Denoting $X_{+t} = \sum_i
X_{it}$ the number of altered patients at position $t$, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
% \{Y_{+t} \geq M^*\} & \Rightarrow & \{X_{+t}, X_{+, t+1},\dots X_{+, t+\ell-1}
% \geq M^*\} \\ 
% \Rightarrow \qquad 
\Pr\{Y_{+t} \geq M^*\} & \leq & \Pr\{X_{+t}, X_{+, t+1},
\dots X_{+, t+\ell-1} \geq M^*\} \\
\Rightarrow \qquad \Pr\left\{\sup_t Y_{+t} \geq M^*\right\} & \leq &
\Pr\{\exists t: X_{+, t-\ell+1}, \dots, X_{+, t-1}, X_{+t} \geq M^*\} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{$\{X_{+t}\}$ as a Markov chain.} Given the number of altered
patients at position $t$ ($X_{+t}$), $X_{+, t+1}$ is
$$
X_{+, t+1} = A_{t+1} + B_{t+1}
$$
where
$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
  A_{t+1} & \sim & \Bcal(X_{+t}, \pi_{1,1})  & \text{number of altered at $t$
  still altered at $t+1$,} \\
  B_{t+1} & \sim & \Bcal(m-X_{+t}, \pi_{0,1})& \text{number of normal at $t$
  becoming altered et $t+1$.}
\end{array}
$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\paragraph{Embedded MC $\{C^*_t\}$.} We can define the MC counting the
number of successive times where $X_{+t}$ exceeds $M^*$, with an
\emphase{absorbing state} when this number reaches $\ell$.

\paragraph{Example.} For $m = 84$ patients, $\ell = 5$ and $M^* = 31$,
the embedded MC has $(m+1) + (\ell-2)(m-M^*+1) + 1 = 248$ states; its
transition matrix has the following shape
$$

\paragraph{$p$-value.}
The $p$-value is given by the distribution of $C^*_n$:
$\mubf^*_0 \left(\Pibf_{c^*}\right)^{n-1}$.

\subsection{Multiple chromosomes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Profiles are actually spread into 24 distinct chromosomes (22 + X + Y) with
varying lengths.

\paragraph{One chromosome.}
Denoting $n_k$ the number of positions in chromosome $k$, the upper
bound of $\Pr\{\sup_{1 \leq t \leq n_k} Y_{+t} \geq M^*\}$ is 
$$
\Pr\left\{\sup_{1 \leq t \leq n_k} Y_{+t} \geq M^*\right\} \leq \mubf^*_0
(\Pibf^*)^{n_k-1} 
$$
where $\mubf^*_0$ denotes the binomial distribution $\Bcal(m,
\mu_1)$.

\paragraph{All chromosomes.} The global upper bound is given by 
$$
\Pr\left\{\sup_{1 \leq t \leq n} Y_{+t} \geq M^*\right\} \leq 1 -
\prod_{k=1}^K \left[1 - \mubf^*_0 (\Pibf^*)^{n_k-1} \right].

\subsection{Abacus}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For given number of patient $m$ and chromosomes lengths $\{n_k\}$, we
can give the abacus of the significance as a function of the length
$\ell$ and the count $M^*$.

\paragraph{Abacus for gains.} Upper bound of the $p$-value in
$\log_{10}$ scale.
