\paragraph{Data:} For each probe $i$, we hence get 2 signals
$$
  X_i = \text{Input signal}, 
  \qquad 
  Y_i = \text{IP signal}.
$$

\bigskip
\paragraph{Problem:} According to these two signals, we \emphase{have to}  
\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} \emphase{Classify each probe} into the
  \emphase{enriched} group or into the \emphase{normal} group,
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} Account for the \emphase{link between the IP and
    Input} signals
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent In addition we \emphase{would like to}
\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} Evaluate the strength of the classification;
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} Avoid numerous false detections.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mixture model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Model.} We assume that each probe $i$ has probability $\pi$
to be enriched:
$$
\Pr\{\text{Probe $i$ enriched}\} = \pi, 
\qquad
\Pr\{\text{Probe $i$ normal}\} = 1 - \pi, 
$$
and that the relation between log-IP ($Y_i$) and log-Input ($X_i$) depends on
the status of the probe:
$$
Y_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    a_0 + b_0 X_i + E_i & \quad \text{if $i$ is normal} \\
    \\
    a_1 + b_1 X_i + E_i & \quad \text{if $i$ is enriched}
  \end{array} \right.
$$

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Comparison with the 'Logratio' analysis.} The standard
analysis based on the log(IP/Input) is the particular case of the
regression mixture model where
$$
b_0 = b_1 = 1.
$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Parameter Estimation and Probe Classification}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Task.} We have to estimate
\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} the proportion of enriched probes: $\pi$;
\item \vspace{-0.5cm} the regression parameters: intercepts ($a_0$,
  $a_1$), slopes ($b_0$, $b_1$) and variance $\sigma^2$.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Algorithm.} This can be done using the E-M algorithm which
alternates
\begin{description}
\item[E-step:] \vspace{-0.5cm} prediction of the probe status given
  the parameters;
\item[M-step:] \vspace{-0.5cm} estimation of the parameters given the
  (predicted) probe status.
\end{description}

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Posterior probability.} The status prediction is based on
the posterior probability $\tau_i$
$$
\textred{\tau_i = \Pr\{\text{$i$ enriched} \; |\; X_i, Y_i\}},
\qquad 1 - \tau_i = \Pr\{\text{$i$ normal} \; |\; X_i, Y_i\}.
$$
This probability provides a \emphase{probe classification rule}.

\chapter{Limiting False Detections}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule.} Probes are usually classified
into their most probable class, using the 50\% threshold:
$$
\begin{array}{rclcl}
  \tau_i & \geq & 50\% & \Rightarrow & \text{$i$ classified as
  'enriched'}, \\ 
  \tau_i & < & 50\% & \Rightarrow & \text{$i$ classified as
  'normal'}. 
\end{array}
$$

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Controlling false detections.} We want to control the
probability for the $\tau_i$ of a normal probe to fall above the
classification threshold. 

For a \emphase{fixed risk $\alpha$} we calculate the threshold $s$
such that
$$
\textred{s: \qquad \Pr\{\tau_i > s \;|\; \text{$i$ normal}, \;
  \log(\text{Input})=X_i\} \leq \alpha}
$$
The threshold $s$ depends on both $\alpha$ and the log-Input $X_i$.
