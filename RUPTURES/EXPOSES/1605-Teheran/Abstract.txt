Exact Bayesian inference for some models with discrete parameters

Bayesian inference often requires the integration over the parameter space. In the case of continuous parameters, the use of conjugate priors may allow to achieve this integration in an exact manner. For models involving discrete parameters the integration over the parameter space is often intractable due to the combinatorial complexity induced by a systematic exploration.

Two models involving a discrete parameter will be considered: (i) change-point detection, in which the set of locations of the change-points is discrete, (ii) the inference of the structure of a graphical model, for which the topology of the underlying graph is discrete as well. In both cases we will show that exact Bayesian inference can be achieved using some specific algebraic properties (up to some restriction in the latter case). 

These properties allow to compute key quantities such as the posterior distribution of the location of a change-point or the posterior probability for a given edge to be part of the graphical model. Both approaches will be illustrated with biological applications.
