	issn = {{0006-341X}},
	abstract = {In the analysis of data generated by change-point processes, one critical challenge is to determine the number of change-points. The classic Bayes information criterion {(BIC)} statistic does not work well here because of irregularities in the likelihood function. By asymptotic approximation of the Bayes factor, we derive a modified {BIC} for the model of Brownian motion with changing drift. The modified {BIC} is similar to the classic {BIC} in the sense that the first term consists of the log likelihood, but it differs in the terms that penalize for model dimension. As an example of application, this new statistic is used to analyze array-based comparative genomic hybridization {(array-CGH)} data. {Array-CGH} measures the number of chromosome copies at each genome location of a cell sample, and is useful for finding the regions of genome deletion and amplification in tumor cells. The modified {BIC} performs well compared to existing methods in accurately choosing the number of regions of changed copy number. Unlike existing methods, it does not rely on tuning parameters or intensive computing. Thus it is impartial and easier to understand and to use.},
