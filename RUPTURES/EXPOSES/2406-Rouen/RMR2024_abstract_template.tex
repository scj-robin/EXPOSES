Change-point detection aims at discovering behavior changes lying behind time sequences data. In this paper, we investigate the case where the data come from an inhomogenous Poisson process or a marked Poisson process.
We will present an offline multiple change-point detection methodology based on minimum contrast estimator. In particular we will explain how to deal with the continuous nature of the process together with the discrete available observations. Besides, we will select the appropriate number of regimes through a cross-validation procedure which is convenient here due to intrinsic properties of the Poisson process.
Through experiments on synthetic and realworld datasets, we will assess ther performances of the proposed method, which is implemented in the CptPointProcess R package.
If time permits, we will describe a clustering version of the aforementioned procedure, which enables to classify segments into a limited number of categories corresponding to unobserved underlying behaviors.
