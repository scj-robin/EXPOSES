\chapter{Mixture Model of Regressions}
\section{Mixture model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Model.} We assume that each probe $i$ has probability $\pi$
to be enriched:
$$
\Pr\{\text{Probe $i$ enriched}\} = \pi, \qquad \Pr\{\text{Probe $i$
normal}\} = 1 - \pi,
$$
and that the relation between log-IP ($Y_i$) and log-Input ($X_i$)
depends on the status of the probe:
$$
Y_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    a_0 + b_0 X_i + E_i & \quad \text{if $i$ is normal} \\
    \\
    a_1 + b_1 X_i + E_i & \quad \text{if $i$ is enriched}
  \end{array} \right. \ \ \ V(Y_i)=\sigma^2
$$

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Comparison with the 'Logratio' analysis.} The standard
analysis based on the log(IP/Input) is the particular case of the
regression mixture model where
$$
b_0 = b_1 = 1.
$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Parameter Estimation and Probe Classification}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Task.} We have to estimate proportion $\pi$, intercepts
$a_0$ and $a_1$, slopes $b_0$ and $b_1$, and variance $\sigma^2$
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \vspace{-0.5cm} the proportion of enriched probes: $\pi$;
%\item \vspace{-0.5cm} the regression parameters: intercepts ($a_0$,
%  $a_1$), slopes ($b_0$, $b_1$) and variances ($\sigma^2_0$, $\sigma_1^2$).
%\end{itemize}

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Algorithm.} This can be done using the E-M algorithm which
alternates
\begin{description}
\item[E-step:] \vspace{-0.5cm} prediction of the probe status given
  the parameters;
\item[M-step:] \vspace{-0.5cm} estimation of the parameters given the
  (predicted) probe status.
\end{description}

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Model selection.} BIC criterion to select between a 1 or
2 population model.

\bigskip\bigskip
\paragraph{Posterior probability.} The status prediction is based on
the posterior probability $\tau_i$
$$
\textred{\tau_i = \Pr\{\text{$i$ enriched} \; |\; X_i, Y_i\}},
\qquad 1 - \tau_i = \Pr\{\text{$i$ normal} \; |\; X_i, Y_i\}.
$$
%This probability provides a \emphase{probe classification rule}.

How to classify a probe according to its posterior probability ?

\chapter{Limiting False Detections}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip
\paragraph{Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule.}
$$
\begin{array}{rclcl}
  \widehat{\tau_i} & \geq & 50\% & \Rightarrow & \text{$i$ classified as
  'enriched'}, \\
  \widehat{\tau_i} & < & 50\% & \Rightarrow & \text{$i$ classified as
  'normal'}.
\end{array}
$$
Misclassifications in 'enriched' group or in 'normal' group have the
same cost.

\paragraph{Controlling false detections.} Control the
probability for the $\tau_i$ of a normal probe to fall above the
classification threshold.

For a \emphase{fixed risk $\alpha$} we calculate the threshold $s$
such that
$$
\textred{s: \qquad \Pr\{\tau_i > s \;|\; \text{$i$ normal}, \;
  \log(\text{Input})=X_i\} = \alpha}
$$
and if $\widehat{\tau_i} > s$ then $i$ is classified as
'enriched'.\\
The threshold $s$ depends on both $\alpha$ and the log-Input $X_i$.\\

\section{Promoter DNA methylation in the human genome}

\paragraph{Data}(Weber \emph{et al.} 2007)

\noindent NimbleGen tiling array of promoter regions of 15\;609
human genes.

\noindent Each promoter region has 15 probes.

\noindent We  consider the Intermediate CpG class of promoters
(2056).

\paragraph{Results}

\noindent A high proportion of enriched probes
($\widehat{\pi}\approx$80\%).

\noindent 403 of the 460 promoter regions found by Weber have 5
enriched probes or more.

\noindent 38 new promoter candidates with 9 enriched probes or more.

\noindent 1 promoter region found by Weber has no enriched probe.

\section{NimbleGen tiling array of \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}}

\paragraph{Data}\\
Study of the histone modification H3K9me3.

\noindent Very high density: more than 1,000,000 probes
($\approx$200,000 per chromosome)

\noindent 2 biological replicates with dye-swap, normalized
according to Kerr et al., 2002

\noindent 3 different analysis methods: NimbleGen software,
ChIPOTle, and Mixture of regression (ChIPmix).

\paragraph{Chloroplastic genome}\\
No target is expected $\Rightarrow$ negative control.

\noindent \textbf{ChIPmix:} BIC selects a single regression model,
i.e. no probe is declared enriched.

\noindent \hspace{-0.7cm} \textbf{ ChIPOTle:} finds 10 to 16 peaks
(depending on parameters).

\noindent \textbf{Nimblegen:} not available.

\textbf{ChIPmix: } $\alpha=0.01$. Probes are clustered in genomic regions.

\noindent \textbf{NimbleGen:} finds smaller genomic regions and
fail to identify some targets.

\noindent \textbf{ChIPOTle: } agrees with ChIPmix, not with NimbleGen.

\textbf{ChIPmix:} + 55\% of the specific probes are validated
targets.

\noindent \textbf{Nimblegen:} - 20\% of the specific probes are
validated targets.



%\noindent More than 75 $\%$ of the probes found MMR and ChIPOTle
%cover genomic regions were biologically validated in Turck
%\textit{et al.} (2007).


\newpage
\chapter{Conclusions}

\noindent New method for analyzing chIP-chip data based on mixture
model of regressions

\paragraph{May be applied to:}

$\bullet$ different biological questions (histone modification, DNA
methylation...)

$\bullet$ different organisms (Arabidopsis, Human)

$\bullet$ different 2-color technologies (tiling/promoter arrays,
high density arrays)

$\bullet$ different situations, whatever the proportion $\pi$

\paragraph{Extensions}

To estimate the proportion of undiscovered enriched probes

Other explicative variables in the regressions can be added (Hits,
CpG rate)
