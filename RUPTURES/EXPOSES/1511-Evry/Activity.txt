I am a senior researcher (DR) at the INRA (French institute for agronomic research). My researches mainly focus on the development of original statistical methods for the analysis of biological data, more specifically genomic data of various types. From a methodological point of view I am interested in latent variable models, change-point detection and network analysis. 
In terms of teaching, I am associated with the M2 “Mathématiques pour les sciences du vivant” from university Paris-Saclay.
