Detection of recurrent alterations: Adapting statistics to data dimension
<<
Modern genomic technologies allow to detect alterations (loss or gain of chromosomal regions) that may occur in the genome of a patient. Then, one is interested in alterations that are frequently observed in a cohort of patient with the same disease, e.g. the same cancer type. Such alteration are named recurrent.

Under simple but reasonable assumptions, the significance of such regions can be rephrased in terms of excursions of some Markovian process. Still the calculation of the corresponding p-value raises combinatorial issues, the complexity of which increases with both the number of patients $n$ and the number of loci $p$. Due to the advances of molecular biology technologies, both numbers have increased in the last decade.

Three approaches will be presented, corresponding to three historical periods. Each approach relies on a different probabilistic tool. CGH array analysis (small $p$n small $n$) can be achieved using finite embedding Markov chain. Continuous time Markov process (birth and death process) can be used to deal with SNP arrays (small $p$, large $n$). As for deep sequencing technologies (NGS: large $p$, large $n$), a limit Ornstein-Uhlenbek process will be introduced.
