Exact Bayesian inference for change-point detection and comparison

Change-point detection arises in many fields, including economics, earth sciences and biology. From a general point of view, the problem is to find changes in the distribution of data collected along 'time'. From a statistical point of view, change-point inference raises a series of specific problem due to the hybrid nature of the parameters to be inferred: the parameters of the emission distributions are typically continuous, whereas the change-point locations are discrete. 

From a Bayesian point-of-view, such a setting requires to be able to integrate over both continuous and discrete sets. Using conjugate priors is convenient to solve the former problem but the later raise serious combinatorial issues due to the large number of possible segmentation of a series of observations.

We will present a series of results showing that the Bayesian inference of some change-point models can be achieved in an exact manner using some algebraic properties of the problem. A series of posterior distributions such as this of the change-point locations or of the total number of change-points can be computed exactly and efficiently. We will also show that these results can be extended to compare the location of change-points in series observed independently.
