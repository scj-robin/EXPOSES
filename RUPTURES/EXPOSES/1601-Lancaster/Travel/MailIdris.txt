Hi Stéphane,

I hope 2016 has started well for you.

I hope your journey goes smoothly tomorrow. In case of any problems my
office number is +44 1524 593066 and my work mobile number is +44 7964
344424.

I’m sure Jennifer explained all this, but once you get to Lancaster train
station - please catch a taxi up to Lancaster University. There are
usually taxis waiting by the entrance to the station.

Ask the driver to drop you off at Fylde avenue. The fare should cost about
£10 (note they accept cash only, so please ask for a  receipt so we can
arrange reimbursement).

When you’ve arrived, please come to my office which is B25, Fylde College
[building 47 on this map:
http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/docume
nts/maps/campus.pdf]. We can then head from there to get a coffee!

I’ve also arranged for you to meet with Rebecca Killick and Matt Nunes
tomorrow (Tue) afternoon. Matt will then take you over to the hotel at the
end of the day, so you can check in.

All the best,

Idris
