Three typical steps.
1. Propose a set of reasonably realistic models;
2. Design an (efficient) algorithm to get the parameter estimates;
3. Choose among the models.

Three typical steps.

2. Design an (efficient) algorithm to get the parameter estimates;
3. Choose among the models.

Example.
1. Nptq is a Poisson process with piece-wise constant intensity function λ:
λptq “ λk

if

τk´1 ď t ă τk .

Parameters: change-points τ “ pτk q1ďkďK ´1 and intensities λ “ pλk q1ďkďK .
2. For a given number of segments K find
p τpq “ arg min CK pN; τ, λq,
pλ,
τ,λ

e.g.

CK pN; τ, λq “ ´ log pK ,τ,λ pNq;

3. Choose the number of segments K .

Dynamic programming (DP) recovers the optimal τpk in Opn2 q (or less), as long as the contrast
(e.g. neg-log-likelihood) is additive [AL89].
