Segmentation (and classification) of point process

0 - Change-point detection
    -> Context point processes (inc. Hawkes) and application in life and environmental sciences
    -> 3 issues = modelling, algorithm, model selection
    
1 - Change-point detection in a Poisson process
    -> algo = OK
    -> model selection (and consistency) ongoing

2 - Segmentation and classification of a Poisson process
    -> straighforward extension of 1
    -> model selection : to do

3 - Segmentation and classification of a Hawkes process
    -> Preceeding approach does not apply (no additive contrast)
    -> Discrete time Haweks process: Markovian reformulation
    -> Segmentation and classification rephrased in terms of an HMM 
        -> Standard E-step
        -> Non-standard M-step
