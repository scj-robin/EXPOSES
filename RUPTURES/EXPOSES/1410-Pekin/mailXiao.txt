The main audience is the student from between BAC+1 and BAC+6, I think they are more interesting in general statistic and their application, and it's difficult to understand some mathematical theories.

Could you show the 3rd sujet about Bayesian inference or 2nd one?

thank you very much!

X.

1 - Detection of genomic alterations via excursion of Markovian processes (applied but rather probabilistic).

2 - Identifiability of HMM, with application to loss of heterozygosity (applied with some general statistical results)

3 - Exact Bayesian inference for change-point models, with application to genome annotation (applied with some general statistical techniques for exact Bayesian inference)

4 - Variational Bayes inference for the inference of the graphon function in a W-graph (using a series of variational approximations, with no specific application, but still some examples)
