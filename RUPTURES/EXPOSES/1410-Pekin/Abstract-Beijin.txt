Excursions of Markov processes with application to the detection of recurrent genomic alterations

Modern molecular technologies allow to detect genomic alterations, such as the loss or the amplification of a portion (region) of the genome of a patient. In a therapeutic perspective, a natural question is then to look for alterations that occur in a substantial fraction of a cohort of patients ill with the same disease, e.g. the same cancer type. Such alterations are named 'recurrent'.

Under simple but reasonable assumptions, the assessment of the significance of such a region can be rephrased in terms of excursion of a Markovian process. Still, the effective calculation of the probability of interest raises combinatorial issues, the complexity of which depends on both the number of patients in the cohort and on the number of loci where alterations can be observed. Indeed, the advances of the molecular technologies contributed to dramatically increase both these two numbers in the last decade.

Three successive approaches will be introduced to evaluate the probability of interest, each adapted to a certain loci density and a cohort size. These approaches are based, respectively, (i) on discrete-time Markov chain embedding, (ii) birth and death processes and (iii) Orstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
