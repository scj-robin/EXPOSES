The exact Bayesian inference for change-point models and their application to genomics will be discussed. The report contains mainly three parts: 1. Change point problem in genomics, which including the problem in genomic data, genomic experiments and genomic technologies; 2. Exact posterior distributions in change point models, which providing a Bayesian framework in inference change point and model selection; 3. Comparing change point locations, which studying the transcription start locations among several independent profiles.
