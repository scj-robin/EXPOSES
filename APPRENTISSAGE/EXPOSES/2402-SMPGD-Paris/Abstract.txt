A partial history of latent variable models in genomics

Latent variable models have been involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the development of genomics since its very beginnings. Mixture models, stochastic Markov models or stochastic block models are just a few examples of latent variable models that have been used, for example, for gene detection, transcriptome analysis or protein interaction network analysis.

These models all assume that only some of the variables involved in the process under study are actually observed. Inferring the parameters of such a model therefore poses specific problems, since it requires reconstituting part of the information concerning unobserved, or "latent", variables. The most common strategy, based on the EM algorithm, requires, for example, the evaluation of the conditional moments of the latent variables conditional on the observed variables. However, this approach proves impractical for models of even moderate complexity.

We will present a series of applications of latent variable models in genomics and the statistical inference problems raised by each of them. In particular, we will show how the development of extensions to the EM algorithm have accompanied the increasing complexity of models used in genomics.
